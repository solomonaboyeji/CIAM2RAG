How to find the right shoe size    A) - TRACE YOUR FEET: Take off your socks, place a piece of paper on the floor, and place your foot on it. Now use a pen to trace the shape of the foot. Hold the pen exactly upright. Important: Both feet must be measured, as they are often of different lengths! We recommend taking the measurement in the evening because feet often swell during the day.   B) - MEASURE YOUR FOOT LENGTH: Measure the length of the foot shape you drew from the heel to the longest toe. You can trace two horizontal lines on the sheet at the heel and toe level to help you with the measurement. Use your longer foot as a guidance.   C) - TIPS:   Shoes sizes are not standardized between brands globally, thus only your personal foot measurement will guide you to the correct size.We calculated the standard allowance of 10-15mm into our foot length recommendation. If you would like to wear very thick socks, please measure your foot with these socks on to get the extra space needed in the shoe.
