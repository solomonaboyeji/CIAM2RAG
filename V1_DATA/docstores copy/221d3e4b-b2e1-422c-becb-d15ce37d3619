Explore our range of all sizes and styles - there's something for everyone.          How to find the correct size    A) - DECALCATE YOUR FEET: Remove your socks, place a sheet of paper on the floor and put your foot on it. Use a pen to decrease the silhouette of your foot. Hold the pen in an upright position. Important: It is better to measure both feet. It is also recommended to carry out measurement in the evening, as the feet tend to swell during the day.   B) - MEASURE THE LENGTH OF YOUR FEET: Measure the length of the shape of the foot, which you just shifted, starting from the heel to the longest toe. You can draw two horizontal lines on the sheet at the heel and toes to help you with the measurement. Use your longest foot as a reference.   C) - SUGGESTIONS:   The sizes are not standardized with brands worldwide and therefore only the length of your feet will allow you to choose the correct size. We have calculated a standard margin in our size guides. If you usually put on very thick socks, you are advised to measure your foot while wearing them, so that you have the extra space needed.
