Also known as a rashie or rash guard, a rash vest is thin, stretchy top   that is an essential for watersports or beach activities. They can be worn   under a wetsuit, on their own with boardshorts or over a bikini.   Why wear a rash vest?   UV Protection: Our rash vests are treated to offer strong protection from   the sun's harmful rays, helping to protect the wearer from sunburn and   long-term skin damage. Great for long days on the beach.   Abrasion: Rash vests protect the wearer from skin abrasion, either from a wetsuit (if worn underneath) or sand & salt water (if worn   standalone)   Heat Loss: Rash vests can help regulate body temperature. Designed to be   tight fitting, they act as a second skin when engaging in water sports.   This added protection allows wearers to spend longer enjoying watersports   activities such as water-skiing, surfing, or bodyboarding, or long days on   the beach. Our stylish designs and a comfortable fit make them both   fashionable and practical.
