I run and walk a lot so those Asics are superb. Price wise these are, at full price, similar to the Asics but would say the Fitvilles don’t quite live up the same quality and functional design detailing of Asics. These get a huge thumbs up for width and arch support built in but I would describe these as general footwear and not sports shoes. The main reasons would be - the fit is a little loose (ironically width) around the arch area of the foot, the heal fit is also a tad too flat so doesn’t fit snuggly to my heal shape. The final issue is the lacing and tongue. The tongue isn’t separate to the sides - more like a slip on - so limits the tightening up. The lacing holes fall short in distance at the ankle compared to most sport specific shoes. This results in a too loose fit around the ankle for running or any sport - in my opinion and for my desired fit - everyone is different.  I would recommend these as wide fit daily footwear but not sports shoes. A real plus for Fitville is the arch support and stock wide fitting that are available. My reason for not simply re ordering Asics comes down to the usual issue with specialist sports brands - they never seem to either have stock or keep the range consistent.', 'review_title': 'Great wide fit shoe but, perhaps, not for sports.', 'date_written': '2022-11-05', 'product_asin': 'B09Y927NYF', 'country': 'the United Kingdom', 'helpful_count': 7, 'rating_given': 4.0, 'review_page_url': 'https://www.amazon.co.uk//FitVille-Trainers-Athletic-Sneakers-Breathable/product-reviews/B0B3J252M4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star', 'sentiment': None, 'product_aspects': None}, {'id': '250a5071-ac77-4a6c-9981-e6f1016e88c1', 'review_ref': 'R2SHADQAVHLFAS', 'product_id': 'fde9e6c3-6ae2-40c6-b9bf-27c726ebfe9b', 'review_content': \"Firstly, I really like fitville shoes, this being my 4th pair.I find the fit brilliant, (I wear the wide, not extra wide), and they're really comfortable.HOWEVER!The tread seems to wear remarkably fast, this pair for instance I've had a week, yup seven days worn probably 4 days and the tread is already disappearing, it's not as I walk much, I'm a driver by trade.My last two pairs were similar and the first pair cracked across the sole making them unwearable.If fitville sorted it's soles then they'd be on to a winner.\", 'review_title': 'Sole wears incredibly fast', 'date_written': '2023-07-16', 'product_asin': 'B09Y927NYF', 'country': 'the United Kingdom', 'helpful_count': 6, 'rating_given': 4.0, 'review_page_url': 'https://www.amazon.co.uk//FitVille-Trainers-Athletic-Sneakers-Breathable/product-reviews/B0B3J252M4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star', 'sentiment': None, 'product_aspects': None}, {'id': '140d93d9-d702-4c6e-a9f6-6812d87dda1a', 'review_ref': 'R82U71W9YL9WA', 'product_id': 'fde9e6c3-6ae2-40c6-b9bf-27c726ebfe9b', 'review_content': 'Ideal if you have bionions and  need the extra toe room', 'review_title': 'Plenty of room extra wide', 'date_written': '2023-10-20', 'product_asin': 'B09Y927NYF', 'country': 'the United Kingdom', 'helpful_count': 0, 'rating_given': 4.0, 'review_page_url': 'https://www.amazon.co.uk//FitVille-Trainers-Athletic-Sneakers-Breathable/product-reviews/B0B3J252M4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star', 'sentiment': None, 'product_aspects': None}, {'id': 'ec2a670a-9774-4297-805a-b96c54e3ecd8', 'review_ref': 'R1WHURYP5ZHTZ5', 'product_id': 'fde9e6c3-6ae2-40c6-b9bf-27c726ebfe9b', 'review_content': 'These are a good solid pair of trainers.

I ordered a 6 but had to size down. Bought for warehouse work. First nite they did hurt my toes a little but seem to be OK now. Dont think they will last forever, but at £24 and I have a second boot to swap, so I'm not wearing every night, I'm happy with them so far.

It has a nice modern design with their black to grey fade colour scheme.  They are light weight and very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.The upper is made from a woven mesh, giving quite a nice appearance and unlike my previous moel that had a “sock design”, meaning there is no tongue, this one is more like a regular shoe, offering a little more support at the heel.The outer sole is quite thick, adding to the cushioning effect on your feet to help with fatigue and has a Kevlar midsole to offer protection from puncturing (up to 1100 N) and of course the toe box has a steel cap to protect your toes from impacts, providing up to 200J / 15KN of crush protection.I ordered these trainers in my usual size 9 and they do fit very nicely. There is just enough wiggle room without them feeling too big.So as far as looks and comfort go, I think this is a great product and performs very well in both areas.The only thing i am not too keen on is the design of the sole, which feels a little slippery. When on the feet, i found them to be quite slippery on carpeted surfaces, but not bad on wood or concrete, although i have a feeling they won’t cope very well with wet or damp surfaces and i’m not sure that they will wear particularly well if your job involves a lot of walking.If they last as well as my previous pair from SROTER, then i think the £39.99 asking price is pretty reasonable and definitely worth considering if you need a pair of safety shoes to wear all day.', 'review_title': 'SROTER - YIYEP - Steel Toe Cap Trainers Safety Shoes', 'date_written': '2023-08-23', 'product_asin': 'B0C812K6RR', 'country': 'the United Kingdom', 'helpful_count': 1, 'rating_given': 4.0, 'review_page_url': 'https://www.amazon.co.uk//YIYEP-Trainers-Lightweight-Industrial-Protective/product-reviews/B0C7W9WQBC/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star', 'sentiment': None, 'product_aspects': None}, {'id': 'de3d8b7c-db22-4bb1-a7d6-13b306e01aeb', 'review_ref': 'RR50VSPGKFV7S', 'product_id': 'b9b7b87e-0786-4842-9d32-252aec8eb314', 'review_content': 'I have been looking for a cheap good quality shoe for a long time and came across these yesterday!!!
