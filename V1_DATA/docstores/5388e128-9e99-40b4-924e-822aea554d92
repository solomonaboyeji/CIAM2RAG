Sturdy but light, they tick all the boxes. The supple, top grade suede looks good but also keeps feet feeling fresh, while breathable mesh that\u2019s woven through each outer gives a breath of fresh air when you need it. Underfoot lies a cushioned EVA midsole designed to absorb the shocks of striding along stunning country paths, and if the terrain gets muddy, the super grip OPTI-STUD simply powers through it to help you on your way. \nProduct Asin: B0772SXKRV \nOverall Ratings 4.4 \nTotal Customers that rated: 100 \nPric: \u00a381.49 \n", "id": null}
