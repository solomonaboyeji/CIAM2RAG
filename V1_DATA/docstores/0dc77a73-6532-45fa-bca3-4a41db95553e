It has a leather and mesh upper, a steel toe cap and midsole, and a shock-absorbing sole. It is also chemical and oil resistant, and antistatic. The DEWALT Laser Safety Boot meets the safety standards of EN ISO 20345:2011 and is rated S1P SRC.       Key Features      Buffalo leather upper provides enhanced durability.     Steel toe cap protects against impact forces up to 200J.     Steel midsole provides underfoot protection to stop hazards piercing through the sole of the boot.                                          Buffalo Leather Uppers   Buffalo leather has an epidermal layer up to three times thicker than cowhide, which means that it can resist abrasion, puncture, and tearing belter than other leathers. Buffalo leather is also not stretched during the tanning process, unlike cowhide.       Steel Toe Cap   Steel toe caps are the most traditional and widely used type of toe cap. They are made of steel and offer the best protection against impact and compression. Steel toe caps can withstand up to 200J of force dropped from a height of up to 18 inches. They are also resistant to punctures, cuts, and abrasions.       Steel Midsole Plate   Underfoot hazards are a common issue on many jobsites. The steel midsole plate in the Laser boots will ensure your feet stay protected and stop these hazards from penetrating through the sole of the boot in to your feet.
