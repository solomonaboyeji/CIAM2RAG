It was 1981.   Back then the outdoors was about intrepid explorers, but we just wanted to open our front door and have fun. And we wanted everyone else out there with us too.   So we made clothing to get people outside and enjoy the fresh air. That\u2019s still what counts for us.   Still thinking of new ways to help people, still inspired by the ideal outdoors and still hanging by the front door when one need us.   And it\u2019s still what counts for the ramblers, amblers, hikers and bikers. campers and gardeners and daily commuters, dog walkers, show jumpers and multi-tasking mums, picnickers, backpackers, kids playing ball and dads at the footie, urban roamers and beachcombers and puddle-loving children and everyone else we\u2019ve helped start their own adventure.            Regatta Men's Stormbreak Waterproof Outdoor Jacket    Waterproof fabric and taped seams - the Stormbreak men's waterproof jacket provides convenient coverage in wet weather. The men's shell jacket is made with waterproof Hydrafort fabric to see off rainfall. The elasticated cuffs keep the elements at bay.
