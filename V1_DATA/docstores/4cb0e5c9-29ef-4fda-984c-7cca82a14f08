The right fit will ensure that your shoes stay on your feet in the roughest of waves and will not float off to sea!   COMFORT: Water shoes are flexible and made with mesh material for enhanced breathability, which helps keep feet cool. That improves water flow when submerged and better drainage when out of the water. They are lightweight and can fold easily after use.   MULTI-PURPOSE USE: An ideal solution to protect your feet and keep them comfortable during outdoor adventures for the whole family. These durable shoes are suitable for stone and sand beach, swimming, weight training, sailing, boating, kayaking, windsurfing, paddling, cycling, walking, running, fishing in the river, beach volleyball or Yoga.
