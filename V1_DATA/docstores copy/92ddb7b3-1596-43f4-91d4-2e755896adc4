SIZE GUIDE                              SIZE CHART   Measurements are desired standards, some variability may occur.       HOW TO MEASURE   WAIST: Measure around your natural waistline - right above your hips. Be careful not to squeeze too tight to allow a little give.   HIPS: With your feet together, measure around the fullest part of your hips to ensure you\u2019ll have enough room to move comfortably.       FITTED   A slimmer, athletic cut that allows total mobility but eliminates the bulk of extra fabric.
