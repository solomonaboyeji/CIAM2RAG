On March 16th, 1966, at street 704E Broadway, in Anaheim, California, Paul Van Doren and three partners opened up their first ever store and the Vans dream was born. The Van Doren Rubber Company was unique in that it manufactures shoes and sells them directly to the public. On that first morning, 12 customers purchase shoes which are made that day and ready for pick-up in the afternoon. The Vans #44 deck shoes, which is now known as the Authentic were born. Vans continues to forge innovative collaborations through the Vault by BVans line with Vans sneaker combinations with design giant Marc Jacobs and OC up-and-comers Trovata flying off the shelves. In 2006 Vans celebrates 40 years at the heart of youth culture.FeaturesLens Width : 55 cm  Version: 100 % polycarbonate  Lens: 100 % polycarbonate  100 % UV protection  surge protectionLENS \nProduct ID: 8a648cb2-09b1-40c5-a109-1264090b444a \nProduct Asin: B0046EC86K \nOverall Ratings 4.2 \nTotal Customers that rated: 3841 \nPrice: \u00a316.0 \n", "id": null}
