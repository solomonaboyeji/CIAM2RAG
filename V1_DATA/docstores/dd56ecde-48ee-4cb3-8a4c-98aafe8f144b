Wrap it around the back and over the top of your head, with the folded edge across your forehead, making sure that about two-thirds of the material is on your left. The right end ought to be long enough to come to your chest.   [Step 2] Use your left hand to pinch the shemagh about 3 or 4 inches from the folded edge and let the edge hang forward.   [Step 3] Let go of the right end. Using your left hand, hold the edge of the shemagh next to your left cheek and hold it near your left cheekbone. After you do this, use your right hand to pull the left end of the shemagh across your face, over your nose.   [Step 4] Continue to wrap the shemagh around your face and head until you get it back over your left shoulder. \nProduct Asin: B07G47K25W \nOverall Ratings 4.5 \nTotal Customers that rated: 3659 \nPric: \u00a39.99 \n", "id": null}
