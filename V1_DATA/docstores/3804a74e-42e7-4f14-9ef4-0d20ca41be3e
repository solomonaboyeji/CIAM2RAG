Once upon a time, ZIZOR originated from a hand tailor. Before this, we customized and modified clothes for residents around our city.   Our shop was also deeply loved by a group of people because of our exquisite craftsmanship and superior quality.   Over time, my staff and I suffered from various degrees of feet fatigue.   So we started to ask ourselves: why can't we live a life with more comfort, which is also the original intention and product core of our brand.
