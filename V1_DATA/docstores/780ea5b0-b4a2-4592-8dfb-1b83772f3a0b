The shirt has been traditionally made with real pleats that run in two panels down the centre, with a classic fly front that conceals the button fastenings.   This is the perfect choice of dress shirt to be seen in at a black tie event, formal wedding or any formal occasion.       Woven cufflinks are included as standard.                                                    Standard Collar   Although not as formal as a wing collar, the standard or classic collar is a much more versatile and popular choice of dress shirt. Whether you are attending a black tie event, a formal wedding or a day at the races, this is the go to choice of collared dress shirt.       Pleated Front   The pleated front is the more traditional dress shirt to wear as part of your Black Tie ensemble. Our pleated front shirts feature 1/2\" pleats running down the front.       Fly Front (Covered Placket)   More commonly known as the fly front, the covered placket is commonly used for tuxedo dress shirts to give your shirt a clean, stylish look. The placket is designed with an extra piece that covers up the buttons down the front of the shirt.       Double Cuffs   Our dress shirts are designed with double cuffs (aka French Cuffs) which are suitable for the wearing of cufflinks, adding that touch of individual flair to your formal outfit. All our dress shirts have woven cufflinks included. \nProduct ID: 780ea5b0-b4a2-4592-8dfb-1b83772f3a0b \nProduct Asin: B005VQ6NJ0 \nOverall Ratings 4.5 \nTotal Customers that rated: 580 \nPrice: \u00a334.99 \n", "id": null}
