Properly measuring yourself can ensure you get the fit you expect from W&H.   How to and what you will need   You will need either:   - a measuring tape   - or a piece of string and a ruler   How to:   1) Keep your arms down by your side and wrap the measuring tape or piece of string beneath your arms around the fullest part of your chest.   2) Mark the spot where the two ends meet around your chest (ensure it is firmly wrapped around)   If you are using a measuring tape, note down the measurement in inches.   If you are using a string, straighten out the string that was wrapped around your chest and measure using the ruler.   If your measurement is in CM, you will have to convert it to inches (divide by 2.54).            Perfect for the busy countryman. One who needs a lightweight, easy-to-care shirt.   Our Murton Shirt is made from polycotton fabric which means it\u2019s easier to iron (sometimes not even required after laundering) and drip dries. The lightweight design keeps you light on your feet to offer extra freedom during your outdoor pursuits.   The extra usability combined with the stylistic versatility makes this a staple wardrobe item in any man\u2019s wardrobe.
