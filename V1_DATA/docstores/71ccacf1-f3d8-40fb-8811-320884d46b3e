They are available in various colors, with fashionable and energetic color stitching. Whether you wear them for daily wear, work, or outdoor sports, these short socks are a perfect fit.   Non-Slip Trainer Socks: These hidden socks come with three silicone soft strips firmly fixed at the heel to ensure the elastic cuff prevent slipping off and stay in place the whole time without causing any discomfort to your feet during exercise or walking.   Ergonomic Design Low Cut Socks: The instep of these casual socks is designed with mesh knitting to offer good breathability, keeping your feet cool and dry, and providing a comfortable wearing experience. The reinforced heel and toe add durability to high-wear areas and extend the lifespan of the socks.   80% Cotton Invisible Socks: These socks are made of 80% combed cotton, 17% polyester, and 3% spandex. The cotton yarn fabric high knitting provides cozy and snug fit. We recommend washing them with cold water and air drying them to avoid machine drying.
