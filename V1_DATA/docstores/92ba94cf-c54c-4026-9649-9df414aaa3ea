The breathable mesh channels on the top absorb sweat and dry fit, refusing to feel stuffy.   Cushioned Athletic Running Socks: The thick sole is wrapped with terry bottom, which is not only shock-absorbing and relieves foot fatigue but also increases wear resistance and prolongs the life of socks. Meanwhile, high-content cushioning ensures comfort for extended training. Reinforced heel and toe for durability and prevents holes. Suitable for UK Size M (5-9 ), and Size L(10-13).   Non-Slip Trainer Ankle Socks: Y-stitch Heel design with ergonomic 3D stereo tailoring can ensure a perfect fit, keeping your heel stable and secure. The elastic cuff tab and extra deep heel prevent socks from slipping down, which also protects against blisters caused by rubbing against the footwear. The flat seam toe ensures protection against yarn chaffing and irritation caused by traditional toe seams.   Breathable Low Cut Socks: Our socks are made of high-quality combed cotton(85% Cotton 12% Polyester 3% Spandex), which is more skin-friendly and softer than ordinary cotton. This material has excellent moisture absorption and breathability, bringing you a comfortable experience when doing sports, keeping your feet dry, and walking without restraint.
