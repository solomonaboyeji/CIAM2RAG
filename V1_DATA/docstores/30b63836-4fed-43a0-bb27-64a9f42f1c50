The water level may go down. If the membrane is faulty/damaged wet areas will appear on the upper materials where water has come through. To dry the boots out, empty the water, and leave to dry, do not leave on direct heat (eg radiator) or in direct sunlight, the drying process can be quicken by stuffing with newspaper and changing the paper a couple of times.      Weathertite is Karrimor's specified waterproof and breathable fabric. First introduced in 1948 and undergoes continual improvement in line with technological advancements to provide durable waterproofness and breathability. In footwear weathertite is a laminate used in a bootie construction and offers an excellent overall performance. \nProduct Asin: B00LIJ1ZFQ \nOverall Ratings 4.5 \nTotal Customers that rated: 10969 \nPric: \u00a345.0 \n", "id": null}
