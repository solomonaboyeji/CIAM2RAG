At UGG we create responsibly-made products featuring materials that are authentic, high quality, comfortable, and durable.   It is essential that our leather materials are derived from responsible sources in relation to both animal welfare and the environment. As we are concerned about the threat of deforestation, we require all tanneries supplying finished leather (cattle hides) originating from Brazil to provide a Leather Working Group audit report demonstrating for this country of origin a 100% traceability to the processing facility, including the date of processing. The tannery must also obtain a certificate from the respective processing facility attesting they have a monitoring system in place to ensure the cattle are not sourced from farms with deforested areas, involved in rural conflicts, with labor analogous to slavery, or involved in the invasion of indigenous and protected areas.              Product description      Here at UGG, fashion is among our greatest passions. With a wide range of trendy shoes for women, men and kids of every taste, plus a broad selection of luxury clothing and accessories, there\u2019s something for everyone this season at UGG.
