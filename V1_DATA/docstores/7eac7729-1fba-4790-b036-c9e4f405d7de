Breathable woven fabric feels smooth and cool. Side vents were designed with the trail athlete in mind, giving you room to move as you navigate the outdoors. A brief liner adds breathable support without hindering motion.

We geared them for more than running, with a comfortable pocket that won't irritate when you move from the track to the gym.               Best Movements of NIKE   This spring, we brought together a collective of powerful, iconic women \u2014 including elite athletes, collaborators, Nike trainers and partners in the world of dance, design, style and photography \u2014 to celebrate the joy, possibility, freedom and boundless expression that can be found in all forms of movement.   Here, they share what it means to move, how to embrace your own style and be your authentic self, and why they feel a call to help empower women and girls to feel their best in their bodies.
