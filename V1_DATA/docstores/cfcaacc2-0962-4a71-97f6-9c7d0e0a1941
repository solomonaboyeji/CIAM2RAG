Is the ground   uneven?Comfort & Fit: Level of mobility vs. support?Climate & Likely Weather: Wet, dry, or changeable?   Walking Shoes are a lightweight option compared to many walking boots. They   are great for flatter / less challenging terrain. More versatile and flexible   than boots, they are a good option when being more nimble is helpful or when   you don't want to carry a change of footwear.   Walking Boots are often preferred for more challenging terrain or poor   weather, as they can offer superior ankle support which can reduce the risk   of twists, strains or sprains.   Bearing these factors in mind will help you to make the best choice for   your adventure.
