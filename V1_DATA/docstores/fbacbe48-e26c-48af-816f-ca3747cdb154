Their idea was to create high-quality, super comfortable products that fit the lifestyle they loved. Fernando and Santi walked everywhere, so they created sandals that could take them to the beach, into town, and wherever they wanted to go - in comfort. The brothers redefined, redesigned and reengineered every component of the sandals. That attention to detail and an uncompromising standard of quality made Reef the most comfortable sandals anybody had ever worn. The innovations that started in 1984 have evolved into the Reef sandals we love today, becoming a symbol of a free, comfortable and happy lifestyle.
