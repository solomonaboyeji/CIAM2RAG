It is a belt that allows you to freely adjust your belt size without the restriction of the holes in the strap. In fact, there are no holes. A tab in the buckle catches a number of notches sewn on the bottom of the leather and allows over 30 size options with 1/4\" between settings. All Nelbons come with a belt strap that can be cut to your exact waist. The full length of one of our straps fits a 48 inch (122 cm) waist width. All buckles are fully removable and interchangeable with compatible Nelbons products. Try Nelbons and see why there's no reason to poke holes in a perfectly good belt. \nProduct Asin: B07DYV8RG8 \nOverall Ratings 4.7 \nTotal Customers that rated: 1076 \nPric: \u00a315.99 \n", "id": null}
