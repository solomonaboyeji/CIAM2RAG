Now use a pen to trace the shape of the foot. Hold the pen exactly upright.   Important: Both feet must be measured, as they are often of different lengths! We recommend taking the measurement in the evening because feet often swell during the day.       Measure your foot length   Measure the length of the foot shape you drew from the heel to the longest toe. You can trace two horizontal lines on the sheet at the heel and toe level to help you with the measurement. Use your longer foot as a guidance.       Tips   Shoes sizes are not standardized between brands globally, thus only your personal foot measurement will guide you to the correct size.  We calculated a standard allowance into our foot length recommendation. If you would like to wear very thick socks, please measure your foot with these socks on to get the extra space needed in the shoe.             Important note: Please see shoe box for UK sizing, size printed in the shoe is US sizing            Product description      As the original One for One company, we've always been in business to improve lives.
