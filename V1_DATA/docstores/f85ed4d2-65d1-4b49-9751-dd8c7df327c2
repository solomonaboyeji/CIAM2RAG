RockDove is the inventor of the two-tone memory foam slipper, launched in 2017. Please beware of the impostors who steal our content but can't live up to our quality. We thank you for choosing RockDove and supporting original work.      What size should I choose if I wear a half-size?   We suggest going up a size if you wear a half-size or an in-between size (e.g. men's 7.5, 9.5, 10.5). To find your best fitting size, please refer to our size chart which can be found by clicking the size chart link next to the size selection menu.      How do I clean these?   All RockDove slippers are made machine washable. We recommend washing in cold water, gentle cycle and air drying.      I'm a lady and want to buy these. What's the right size for me?   Please use this simple conversion rule: add 1 to the men's size to get the ladies' size. For example, the men's size 8/9 is the same length as the ladies' size 9/10, but slightly wider. We also recommend the RockDove Ladies' Two-Tone Slipper.                   Making feet (and paws) happy since 2002.   Slippers that don't look boring.    That's our goal. The RockDove two-tone slipper is inspired by the vibrant hues of southern California, where we call home. Born with the laid-back vibes of a SoCal beachtown, it's easy to slip on and kick off, with a go-anywhere sole that lets you step out without switching shoes.

To achieve this, we dedicate 100% of our working lives to making slippers and nothing else, nothing to distract us from our craft.         What sets RockDove apart from the rest     Innovation: we experiment with features and fabrics typically reserved for performance footwearEthical Manufacturing: no animal skins used; fair wages and safe conditions for workers (amfori BSCI-audited)Consistent Sizing: every product is fit-tested to standard UK shoe sizing prior to production          Slippers for Frontline Heroes         Throughout 2020, RockDove is giving away slippers to healthcare workers and first responders who are fighting the pandemic on the frontlines. We can't imagine what it feels to be in their shoes, so we're giving them ours -- RockDove memory foam slippers to rest their tired feet after a long shift.          Who We Are     RockDove was created for five birdwatchers of the Los Angeles Audubon Society in 2002. They were our customers, when we weren't yet a slipper company, but a beachside workshop in Santa Monica, California that resoled hiking boots. For fifteen years we protected the feet of avid adventurers as they trekked punishing terrains across southern California's mountains and deserts. As their local shoe cobbler, when customers had footwear needs, they came to us. And over time they asked for something that was badly missing, not in their time conquering the outdoors but in their lives at home\u2014quality indoor shoes to console their high-mileage, trail-weary feet. So for Christmas that year, we made five pairs of slippers for our long-time Audubon customers using a low-cut boot last.   Shoe brands in southern California, where sunny beaches and flip flops rule, don't pay much attention to slippers. So we had little to build on. But we did know how to make comfortable, long lasting footwear. Using mattress memory foam, gel insoles, anti-shock EVA from hiking boots, and more, we designed slippers with the goal of comforting extremely tired feet. Two months later when we sent out a newsletter about our slipper experiment, customers responded with 350 mail orders. We named our slippers after the most common bird we knew, the rock dove (pigeon) often seen strutting the boardwalks of Santa Monica Pier. They\u2019re a memento of where we\u2019re from and what we represent.   To this day our legacy of creating footwear as if for the most exhausted, adventure-wearied feet lives on. But adventure isn\u2019t always hanging on a rope off the side of a mountain. Everyone lives their own version of it, every single day. We make slippers so that anyone who\u2019s on their feet all day\u2014not just passionate outdoorsmen but teachers, chefs, nurses, cashiers, traffic cops, postal workers, and more\u2014can count on switching into the world\u2019s most comfortable slippers once they get home.   Our quest to get comfort down to a science pushed us to become one of the earliest adopters of high-density memory foam in slippers. In 2004, we reached out to local sleep experts at the Long Beach Mattress Company to source their memory foam toppers, which we then moulded into insoles. But mattress comfort didn't exactly translate to slipper comfort. So we obsessively tweaked the density and firmness of our foams to create that \u201csweet spot\u201d level: one that offers incredible comfort, yet not so much cushioning that you\u2019ll feel like walking in quicksand. Today, at the heart of each RockDove slipper is a multilayered foam construction\u2014a 40-70D memory foam that rebounds with every step, a heel insert that adds firmness, and an anti-shock EVA layer.
