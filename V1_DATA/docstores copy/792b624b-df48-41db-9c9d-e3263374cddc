Rieker   attaches importance to the right functionality for everyday life so that the   wearer feels good all day long. The Rieker brand has achieved cult status   among consumers who want to look good and at the same time are looking for   functionality that really helps them in everyday life.   From the   very beginning it has been the philosophy of Rieker to offer not only a good   product but the best there is to buy.                                            Lighter   A   minimum amount of weight makes our shoe models with the anti-stress   properties particularly comfortable to wear \u2013 you hardly feel them on your   foot! This is good for the muscles and makes us feel more in shape and   invigorated all-round.       More Flexible   As   flexible as you! All models with the Rieker anti-stress properties provide   the highest degree of flexibility! This allows the foot to move more easily   and you are more mobile overall.       Roomier   A fit   where the foot does not adjust to the shoe, but the shoe adjusts to the foot?   No problem! Our shoes give you the space you need. This is how our   anti-stress shoes fit you even after a long walk - without annoying pressure   in the shoe!       More shock absorption   The   shock absorption not only gives you a good feeling and safety, it also   cushions your every step on different surfaces thanks to the memory foam in   the sole or insole and is therefore particularly easy on your joints and   back. For all the activities that you have planned.                        Product description      Rieker shoes are not merely decorative, fashionable, products.
