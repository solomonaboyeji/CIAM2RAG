Product Highlights                                      Quick Drying   One of the all time favourite features of these shirts is the speed in which they dry. The fabric doesn't hold water, so doesn't become heavy and drys fast out of the wash. This also makes them a great choice at the pool or beach, unlike a cotton shirt which becomes heavy and takes an age to dry.       2-Way Stretch Fabric   A stretchy fabric which doesn't lose it's shape. The fabric stretches both ways; side to side and top to bottom, allowing it to fit and move with your body perfectly. No matter how you wear yours, under your work clothes sat in an office, or after an intense gym session, this shirt offers exceptional performance in all applications.       Breathable & Moisture Wicking   Unique moisture wicking fabric which draws sweat away from the skin and allows it to evaporate away from the body, keeping you cool & comfortable. A highly breathable fabric combined with a lightly textured design allows hot air & moisture out, and cool air in.       UPF 40+ Protection   Clothing with a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) of over 40 helps to shield your skin against ultraviolet rays. Many don't think about UPF ratings when buying clothing, but not all T-shirts are created equal. As a comparison, a regular cotton T-Shirt has a UPF of about 5.   These shirts have a UPF rating of 40+, making them the perfect choice for summer months & holidays, not just inside the gym. Also, the unique fabric doesn't hold on to water so they're also a great option at the pool or beach.               Size Guide    Quick drying breathable sports t-shirt   Quick drying, breathable short sleeved t-shirt suitable for a huge range of sporting activities. Great for running, jogging, cycling, yoga, casual wear, working out, fitness, training, charity events and of course at the gym.
