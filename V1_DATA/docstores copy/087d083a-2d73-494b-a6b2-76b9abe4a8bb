Their idea was to create high-quality, super comfortable products that fit the lifestyle they loved. Fernando and Santi walked everywhere, so they created sandals that could take them to the beach, into town, and wherever they wanted to go - in comfort. The brothers redefined, redesigned and reengineered every component of the sandals. That attention to detail and an uncompromising standard of quality made Reef the most comfortable sandals anybody had ever worn. The innovations that started in 1984 have evolved into the Reef sandals we love today, becoming a symbol of a free, comfortable and happy lifestyle.                                      FANNING MEN'S SANDALS   Reef's best selling flip flops for men with a bottle opener in the sole of the sandal. They are handcrafted with a comfortable footbed and anatomical arch support.       BOTTLE OPENER   Use the church key bottle opener integrated into the rubber outsole giving you thirst quenching technology (TQT) on the go. REEF is the only men's sandal with a bottle opener.       ARCH SUPPORT   Anatomical arch support flip flops for men give you a refreshing feel of satisfaction every time you slip your feet into your Fannings.                  Meet the OG of REEF   The Fanning, named after three-time world surf champion Mick Fanning. High-rebound EVA cushions the footbed, and the sole includes not only an airbag, but our famous bottle opener, which means you're pretty much set for life. \nProduct ID: 087d083a-2d73-494b-a6b2-76b9abe4a8bb \nProduct Asin: B00ZUY5TIO \nOverall Ratings 4.7 \nTotal Customers that rated: 42969 \nPrice: \u00a332.44 \n", "id": null}
