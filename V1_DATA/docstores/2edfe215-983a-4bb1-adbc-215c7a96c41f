Perfect for brisk fall mornings, late summer runs, or spring hikes, the Waterproof All Weather Socks provide the right balance of warmth, breathability and waterproof protection.   Wet feet can lead to all sorts of issues outdoors including blisters, numbness and worse. Sealskinz All Weather Waterproof Socks will keep you protected, dry and comfortable through rainy walks with the dog, standing in leaky waders, dewy grass, rain puddles and muddy terrain.   Innovative materials and construction   With more 4-way stretch than any waterproof sock on the market, you can be sure that you\u2019ll benefit from a close fit as well as superior comfort. Using a three layer construction with a unique hydrophilic waterproof membrane, the Waterproof All Weather Mid Length Socks are incredibly breathable since the membrane moves moisture away from the skin at the molecular level using osmosis. This means our waterproof socks keep you comfortable and dry no matter what conditions you come across.   The addition of our unique Hydrostop technology creates a barrier to water ingress providing a secure fit between the sock and your leg. Using a silicone free elastic taping, the sock cuff is closer to skin reducing the risk of water run down. The soft taping has elastic properties that makes the waterproof sock with Hydrostop a natural fit that stays secure during all sorts of outdoor activities.

Product description      In serious downpours water can bead up on bare legs and calves and egress into the socks through the top. So we invented Hydrostop\u2122, a silicone-like (although it is silicone-free) elastic taping around the inside cuff of the sock. This added protection reduces the chances of water dripping down your leg into your sock.
