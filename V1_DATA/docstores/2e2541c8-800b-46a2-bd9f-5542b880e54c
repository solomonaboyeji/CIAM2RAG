After something more subtle? Try the new Green colour that still has all the Hi-Visibility features.            Buckler BBZ8000 Black and Orange          Buckler BBZ8000 Black and Yellow          Buckler BBZ8000 Grey and Green          Buckler BBZ8000 Green              The BBZ8000 doesn\u2019t stop at merely being functional. It is also visually striking with its Hi-Viz colour contrasts and reflective enhancement.    This 360\u00b0 reflective safety wellington boot is non-metallic and boasts built-in EN certified ankle impact protection (AN) and Achilles support, standing apart from its competition. The BBZ8000 adopts a different assembly process from the BBZ6000 and uses a super lightweight nano safety toecap, a lightweight anti-penetration midsole and a weight saving sole bonding process. It's comparable in weight to its moulded polyurethane competitors but stands out with its glove-like fit.        We always knew that BBZ6000 would be a hard act to follow but we also knew that by continually researching and developing new ideas we could produce an even better product. One with immense visual impact and bristling with innovation. One which would pick up on the amazing success of BBZ6000 and take the EN S5 neoprene/rubber safety boot concept which we pioneered in 2008 on to new horizons.   BBZ8000 uses a completely different assembly process from its older brother, BBZ6000 plus a host of new safety features and lightweight components. In addition it's 360\u00ba reflective, non-metallic and has built in EN certified ankle impact protection (AN) and Achilles support.   BBZ8000 features a super lightweight nano safety toecap, a lightweight anti-penetration midsole and a weight saving sole bonding process. It's comparable in weight to its moulded polyurethane competitors and just like its older brother it fits like a glove, not like a tube.   Design Status:   Registered Protection.
