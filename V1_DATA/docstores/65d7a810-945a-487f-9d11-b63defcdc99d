SIZE GUIDE      SIZE CHART   Measurements are desired standards, some variability may occur.       HOW TO MEASURE   FOOT: We start with the true foot, which means we measure from heel to toe. That measurement (in centimeters) is then translated into our standard sizes.   To find your foot measurement closely trace your entire foot onto a piece of paper and measure from heel to toe. If your measurement is between chart numbers, we recommend sizing up. Be sure you\u2019re putting your full weight on your foot while tracing. Please note: for the best results, measuring later in the day is recommended.   We created this easy-to-use sizing chart so that finding the right size shoes for your kids won\u2019t be a workout in itself. *Due to the metric/imperial conversions, there will be some instances where two US sizes will equal one UK size or one CM size.
