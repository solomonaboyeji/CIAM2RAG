Lightweight and breathable, it is ideal as an outer layer or as part of an effective three way layer. Great value, versatile and perfect for outdoor activities or everyday casual wear during colder days.  What Is A Micro Fleece? Thin and lightweight microfleeces are a great mid-layer but are also ideal outerwear in milder weather. A microfleece will provide a low level of insulation whilst the breathable properties make them perfect for active pursuits.  Weight is the key priority with this type of mid layer so you are unlikely to find features such as pockets or hoods.         Common Features      Half Zip   Fleece tops will have a full zip or a half zip that runs from the collar to partway down the chest. A full zip unzips like a jacket. A half zip fleece goes over your head like a jumper & opens at the neck.       Antipill   When a fleece is described as anti-pill this means the fabric has been treated to prevent little balls (or pills) of thread appearing on the surface of the fabric to keep the fleece bobble free for longer.       Quick Drying   Fast drying material of this outerwear ensures you aren\u2019t cold and wet after a down pour. This mens clothing is great for washing and wearing while travelling and camping. \nProduct Asin: B0BHPM9T5D \nOverall Ratings 4.4 \nTotal Customers that rated: 1465 \nPric: \u00a313.99 \n", "id": null}
