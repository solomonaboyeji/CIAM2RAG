Measure chest circumference   Place the tape measure around the chest at the widest point, just under the armpits. Make sure that the tape measure does not cut in. You should only wear thin clothing when measuring, so as not to distort the values.       2. Measure waist circumference   Place the tape measure around the waist - at the narrowest point, just above the belly button.       3. Waist measurement:   Place the tape measure around the hips - at the widest point of the hips and buttocks. Make sure that the tape measure on its back does not hang down or protrude.              Notes:   If you are between sizes, order the smaller size for a tighter fit or the larger size for a further fit. If you receive two different size suggestions for your waist and waist measurements, order the size according to your hip circumference.   Tops in large sizes (height 183 cm to 196 cm): Tops are 4.5 cm longer than normal tops. The sleeve length has been proportionally adjusted depending on the silhouette. Large sizes are available for selected tops only.   Tip: If you do not have a tape measure at hand, you can use a thread and then measure its marked length with the ruler.
