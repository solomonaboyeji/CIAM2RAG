Archer Watch Straps honors this esteemed history with our own Classic NATO, pairing sleek, premium nylon with rugged, waterproof, stainless steel hardware.   FLAWLESS DESIGN \u2013 Our Classic NATO uses the simple, innovative \u201cY-Strap.\u201d The resulting extra loop ensures that if one of your watch\u2019s spring bars fails, the other will keep that treasured time-piece on your wrist. Our fabric is woven with time-tested, heavy-duty stitching, so unlike bands that use cheap heat-bonding, our seams won\u2019t come apart. True watch-heads will appreciate the reliable \u201cmil-spec\u201d buckle. Oh, and did we mention our nylon is waterproof, durable, and incredibly comfortable?   A FIT FOR ANY WRIST \u2013 We love the length of the original NATO, so we stuck with it. Our ample band comfortably fits wrists from about 14cm to roughly 22cm in circumference. And don\u2019t worry, any excess tucks away easily and stylishly. We\u2019ve also spaced our stainless steel keeper rings to allow added slack in the loop. This gives you more flexibility for placement of the watch and buckle along the band. Ever had a buckle sit awkwardly on your wrist when the strap is tightened? Not on our watch.   ALWAYS IN STYLE \u2013 Here at Archer Watch Straps, we consider the NATO the Wayfarer of watch straps. That\u2019s why it was our very first model. A perfect balance of fashion and function, our nylon bands are clean, classic, and timelessly sharp. Pared down to traditional monochrome and simple stripes, we\u2019ve curated our palette to reflect an elegant look that isn\u2019t over the top, so you can dress the part for any occasion.   YOUR SATISFACTION \u2013 We don\u2019t just make watch straps. We love watch straps. And we want you to love yours too. If you don\u2019t, let us know. Having problems with the fit? We offer a money back guarantee. Something else that\u2019s not quite right? Contact us. That strap you just bought is proudly backed by a Two-Year Replacement Warranty. The bottom line\u2026 your Archer Watch Strap should look impeccable, hold up, and feel comfortable. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll make it right.
