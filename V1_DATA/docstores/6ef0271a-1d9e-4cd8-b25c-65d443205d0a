BLACKOUT ensures you're always protected. With our secure RFID blocking card EVERY card is protected, making it impossible for anyone to access your data.   In a conventional wallet, contactless cards cannot be stored safely. These cards can be activated, read and copied at a distance of up to 30 meters, without you noticing a thing. BLACKOUT prevents your cards being read by blocking these unwanted RFID signals from any distance by digital pickpockets.            TRUSTED CONTACTLESS PROTECTION                                      ULTRA SLIM DESIGN   AKIELO's UK design team created a simple yet stylish design, which is ultra slim yet has all the functionality you need to keep your contactless cards safe when you are on the go or travelling abroad.   With BLACKOUT, all payment cards placed within a 10cm radius (5cm each side) are kept secure by our 24-7 privacy field.       CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY   The core of the BLACKOUT card is our micro-jamming technology, an advanced processor chip and antenna specifically programmed to scramble and block any incoming RFID or NFC signals.   Plus, BLACKOUT doesn't affect your phone signal, WiFi or bluetooth.       INSERT AND FORGET   BLACKOUT is credit card sized and only 0.9mm thin, so you can simply add it to any size wallet or purse card slot, with no need for individual card protector sleeves to fiddle with each time you want to use your cards.
