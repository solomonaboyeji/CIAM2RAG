Unrivaled Comfort   These straps proudly embody the tenets of the Archer design aesthetic \u2013 a refined simplicity with crisp, clean lines that evoke a classic style. Oh, and did we mention that they\u2019re incredibly soft? We did. We know we did. But really\u2026 these babies are downright velvety.             Selecting Your Size        Let\u2019s get down to brass tacks, folks. Determining the correct size strap for your particular watch is essential. The good news? It\u2019s pretty easy to do. The proper strap size for your watch correlates directly to its lug width, or the space between the watch\u2019s lugs. The lugs, or \"arms\", are simply the little points on the watch face itself, where the strap attaches. Measure the space between them (in millimeters), and you\u2019ve got your strap size. There's an illustration for reference in the pictures section above. And if you still aren\u2019t sure, you can always check your manufacturer\u2019s specs. Our quick release silicone watch band comes in 16mm, 18mm, 19mm, 20mm, 21mm, 22mm, 23mm, and 24mm sizes. So, once you find the size that works for your watch, you can get to the fun part \u2013 snagging the colors that catch your eye.   PLEASE NOTE: Certain watches have unusual lug widths which will be slightly too wide for the spring bars to hold securely, so make sure you measure precisely.
