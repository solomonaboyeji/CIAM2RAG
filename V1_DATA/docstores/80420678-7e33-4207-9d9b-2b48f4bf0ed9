Today\u2019s Fruit range has more styles, choices, sizes and colour than ever before. Since we\u2019ve been one of the leading garment manufacturer for over 165 years; our range, quality, service and value is second to none.   Every garment in the collection is ethically produced and every item is designed to give perfect results for every kind of decoration.   Whether you\u2019re looking for garments suitable for leisure, promotion, work wear, music merchandising, school uniform or sport we\u2019ve complementary styles for men, ladies and kids across a comprehensive collection of t-shirts, sweats, shirts, performance and more including underwear.   For colour and choice from a brand you can always count on, Fruit of the Loom offers you everything under the sun!            Quality Garments start with Quality Products     We pride ourselves on using the best fabrics to make all of our quality garments. This starts with the use of the finest raw cotton. As a company committed to the respect for human rights, we only use ethically produced yarn to manufacture our garments. The majority of our raw cotton is from the USA.   Using the best quality raw materials, our manufacturing techniques also ensure that our fabrics meet market requirements. For example, our 100% cotton T-shirts are manufactured with a fine knit gauge for unbeatable printing performance and a revolutionary knitting technique means all of our Sweats are manufactured with 100% cotton face, keeping the polyester at the back of the Sweat fabric and the cotton at the front. This technique gives each Sweat greater durability and unbeatable pilling performance.          Complete Control from Start to Finish     Control is vitally important to Fruit of the Loom and our huge custom-built manufacturing plant in Morocco gives us the control we need to bring you the garments you count on us for. Situated on a site the size of around 73 football pitches, our main building is the second-largest in the whole of Africa and we are entirely self-sufficient with our own sub-station and water treatment and recycling facilities. Here we produce all our own garments over 2 million every week and the product quality and ethical certainty of every single one of them can be assured by us.
