It has a nice modern design with their black to grey fade colour scheme.  They are light weight and very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.The upper is made from a woven mesh, giving quite a nice appearance and unlike my previous moel that had a \u201csock design\u201d, meaning there is no tongue, this one is more like a regular shoe, offering a little more support at the heel.The outer sole is quite thick, adding to the cushioning effect on your feet to help with fatigue and has a Kevlar midsole to offer protection from puncturing (up to 1100 N) and of course the toe box has a steel cap to protect your toes from impacts, providing up to 200J / 15KN of crush protection.I ordered these trainers in my usual size 9 and they do fit very nicely. There is just enough wiggle room without them feeling too big.So as far as looks and comfort go, I think this is a great product and performs very well in both areas.The only thing i am not too keen on is the design of the sole, which feels a little slippery. When on the feet, i found them to be quite slippery on carpeted surfaces, but not bad on wood or concrete, although i have a feeling they won\u2019t cope very well with wet or damp surfaces and i\u2019m not sure that they will wear particularly well if your job involves a lot of walking.If they last as well as my previous pair from SROTER, then i think the \u00a339.99 asking price is pretty reasonable and definitely worth considering if you need a pair of safety shoes to wear all day.", "review_title": "SROTER - YIYEP - Steel Toe Cap Trainers Safety Shoes", "date_written": "2023-08-23", "product_asin": "B0C812K6RR", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 1, "rating_given": 4.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//YIYEP-Trainers-Lightweight-Industrial-Protective/product-reviews/B0C7W9WQBC/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "de3d8b7c-db22-4bb1-a7d6-13b306e01aeb", "review_ref": "RR50VSPGKFV7S", "product_id": "b9b7b87e-0786-4842-9d32-252aec8eb314", "review_content": "I have been looking for a cheap good quality shoe for a long time and came across these yesterday!!!

I run and walk a lot so those Asics are superb. Price wise these are, at full price, similar to the Asics but would say the Fitvilles don\u2019t quite live up the same quality and functional design detailing of Asics. These get a huge thumbs up for width and arch support built in but I would describe these as general footwear and not sports shoes. The main reasons would be - the fit is a little loose (ironically width) around the arch area of the foot, the heal fit is also a tad too flat so doesn\u2019t fit snuggly to my heal shape. The final issue is the lacing and tongue. The tongue isn\u2019t separate to the sides - more like a slip on - so limits the tightening up. The lacing holes fall short in distance at the ankle compared to most sport specific shoes. This results in a too loose fit around the ankle for running or any sport - in my opinion and for my desired fit - everyone is different.  I would recommend these as wide fit daily footwear but not sports shoes. A real plus for Fitville is the arch support and stock wide fitting that are available.

The shoe is light, with side and upper inner meshing as well as some ventilation holes along the side doing a good job to help keep the feet cool in the summer months. The structure around the heel is pretty good and although the lip folds in, the rest of the structure usually remains upright, making for a shoe that's easier to slip on without needing a horn or a pull tab.On the negative side, this iteration seems to have a pretty poor insole design, that starts wearing away pretty quickly with extended use.

Much better than expected, providing a greater incentive for me to hide them from the dog. But if needs must, a swift reorder is on the cards........", "review_title": "Dog keeps eating my slippers", "date_written": "2024-01-04", "product_asin": "B08KL9XLG1", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 2, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//Slipper-Company-Mens-Burgundy-Striped/product-reviews/B00FYWS3J4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "bbd67ae3-a9eb-44dc-9107-53edd792f7bd", "review_ref": "R1WT708EEA92KA", "product_id": "66c88e18-993e-4863-bb21-65bcc524abf1", "review_content": "These slippers are a very good size 9 fit, and they are very comfortable.", "review_title": "These slippers are a very good size 9 fit, and they are very comfortable.", "date_written": "2024-03-26", "product_asin": "B08KL9XLG1", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//Slipper-Company-Mens-Burgundy-Striped/product-reviews/B00FYWS3J4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "b17ad158-7041-4e46-b71a-3b9c5f0e97ab", "review_ref": "R8B218NTY4SEH", "product_id": "66c88e18-993e-4863-bb21-65bcc524abf1", "review_content": "present good fit", "review_title": "good fit", "date_written": "2024-03-25", "product_asin": "B08KL9XLG1", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//Slipper-Company-Mens-Burgundy-Striped/product-reviews/B00FYWS3J4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "eed3170a-3850-4f07-b15a-7c1394b8ef06", "review_ref": "R2IAXIH0QWL69H", "product_id": "66c88e18-993e-4863-bb21-65bcc524abf1", "review_content": "Great quality.

Trotz K\u00f6rperma\u00dfe und Hobby Sport habe ich einen recht aggessiven Spielstil mit vielen schnellen, auch seitlichen, Richtungswechseln. Daher suche ich einen Schuhe mit gutem Seitenhalt und guter St\u00fctzung. \u00dcbelicherweise trage ich Gr\u00f6\u00dfe 46, habe mir den Schuh aufgrund anderer Rezensionen in 46 2/3 bestellt.Erster Test im Wohnzimmer:Hatte als andere Alternative einen \"normalen\" Hallenschuh einer anderen Marke bestellt, der sich auch ganz \"normal\" angef\u00fchlt hat. Im Vergleich f\u00e4llt sofort auf, wie steif der Spezial ist. Im ersten Moment unangenehm, aber wenn man die ersten schnellen Schritte und Richtungswechsel macht, ist das gro\u00dfartig.Als n\u00e4chstes f\u00e4llt beim normalen Gehen oder leichtem Joggen die harte Kante der Sohle an der Verse (gegen\u00fcber der Rundung vieler anderer Schuhe) auf. geschmeidiges Abrollen kann man vergessen. Aber auch das ist bei flotten, kurzen Bewegungen und Spr\u00fcngen kein Problem und tr\u00e4gt evtl. sogar noch etwas zur Stabilit\u00e4t bei.Dann zur allgemeinen Passform: nach ein paar Minuten im Wohnzimmer kam ich zu dem Schluss, dass der Schuh zwar nicht bequem ist, aber an sich gut passt und seinen Job gut machen sollte. Auf jeden Fall viel stabiler als ein normaler Hallenschuh - das hat halt seinen Preis.Test beim Badminton:Gestern dann f\u00fcr 1,5h beim Badminton getestet und eine b\u00f6se \u00dcberraschung erlebt...Das positive zuerst - der Schuh bietet wirklich genialen Halt, man hat volles Vertrauen in jeden Richtungswechsel und auch ein gutes Gef\u00fchl, nicht umzuknicken, auch wenn man mal unsauber landet. Auch der geringere Comfort f\u00e4llt im Spiel \u00fcberhaupt nicht auf.Nun das Problem und der Grund f\u00fcr die R\u00fccksendung:Ich habe erst nach einigen Minuten angefangen es zu merken, aber alles rund um die \u00d6ffnung ist schlicht etwas zu weit hoch gezogen und eben auch genauso steif wie der restliche Schuh. Betrifft bei mir besonders die Kn\u00f6chelinnenseite und die Lasche vorne. Das mag nat\u00fcrlich zur Stabilit\u00e4t beitragen, hat aber auch einen dramatischen Nebeneffekt, wenn Fu\u00df und vor allem Kn\u00f6chelform nicht 100 % zum Schuh passen - bereits nach einer Dreiviertelstunde h\u00e4tte ich aufgrund der Schmerzen am liebsten aufgeh\u00f6rt oder Schuhe gewechselt (hatte aber keine anderen dabei). Trotz gut passenden Sportsocken hat mit die Lasche die Haut vorne am Kn\u00f6chel aufgerieben, ebeso wie der Seitenteil die Haut unterhalb des inneren Kn\u00f6chels. Der Bereich ist durch den Druck zus\u00e4tzlich noch geschwollen. Davon werdich wohl noch einige Tage was haben.Daher geht der Schuh - eigentlich schon leider - zur\u00fcck. W\u00e4re er um den Kn\u00f6chel herum etwas niedriger, w\u00e4re er perfekt f\u00fcr meine Anwendung. So ist es aber keinerlei Option. Insbesondere da der Schuh nicht den Eindruck machen als w\u00fcrde er sich auch nut im Gerinsten an den Fu\u00df anpassen...Da das Problem sicher nicht bei jedem besteht, probiert ihn gerne aus, aber stellt euch drauf ein zur\u00fcckschicken zu m\u00fcssen - und nehmt einen Wechselshuh mit, wenn ihr einen l\u00e4ngeren Test plant...", "review_title": "So steif und hoch, dass er perfekt passen muss - bei mir leider nicht der Fall", "date_written": "2024-02-09", "product_asin": "B07K4RV99Z", "country": "Germany", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 2.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//adidas-Mens-Handball-Spezial-Sneaker/product-reviews/B0CYV2FZDT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "f9a7dab8-a582-41f6-b61d-30f7ccb7afd9", "review_ref": "R2V8F4I37N1LBS", "product_id": "ae7576ea-e6d2-46cc-9bcc-625803a37942", "review_content": "Produkt ok\u00e9.

These trainers with steel toe caps have given me a newfound confidence in my work. I've accidentally dropped heavy tools on my feet, and thanks to these shoes, I walked away without a scratch. That's a peace of mind I can't put a price on.But it's not just about safety; they're surprisingly comfortable too. I used to come home with sore feet after long days, but these trainers provide incredible cushioning and support. It's like walking on clouds, even on those tough, uneven surfaces.What's impressive is their durability. I've put them through some serious abuse, and they still look almost brand new. They're built to last, which is a huge relief considering how often I used to replace my old work shoes.Now, here's the fun part - they don't look like your typical clunky work shoes. They've got a modern, stylish design that doesn't scream \"safety shoes.\" I've even worn them outside of work, and they blend right in.To sum it up, these safety trainers have truly changed the game for me. They've got safety, comfort, durability, and style all rolled into one. If you're in the market for work shoes, do yourself a favor and give these a try.

Measure chest circumference   Place the tape measure around the chest at the widest point, just under the armpits. Make sure that the tape measure does not cut in. You should only wear thin clothing when measuring, so as not to distort the values.       2. Measure waist circumference   Place the tape measure around the waist - at the narrowest point, just above the belly button.       3. Waist measurement:   Place the tape measure around the hips - at the widest point of the hips and buttocks. Make sure that the tape measure on its back does not hang down or protrude.              Notes:   If you are between sizes, order the smaller size for a tighter fit or the larger size for a further fit. If you receive two different size suggestions for your waist and waist measurements, order the size according to your hip circumference.   Tops in large sizes (height 183 cm to 196 cm): Tops are 4.5 cm longer than normal tops. The sleeve length has been proportionally adjusted depending on the silhouette. Large sizes are available for selected tops only.   Tip: If you do not have a tape measure at hand, you can use a thread and then measure its marked length with the ruler.

However, I have to admit to being disappointed.I ordered size L - I am a 34\" waist with a 30\" inside leg measurement.  The waist fits perfectly without being tight at all, there is enough room in the body section of the sweatpants so they remain casual and comfortable without being tight, but the legs?  They are barely 30\" long and if I hoist the waist up a bit then they rise almost above the ankles.  Given there was no choice of leg length, either I received a faulty pair or else the expectation is that for size L then men will have short-regular sized legs, which is rarely the case and probably a good job that my leg length was not longer.The fabric itself is comfortable to wear but I found it very thin.  They offer no actual warmth, they simply cover the body and legs.  The leg design is straight leg so the legs, at least, are as comfortable as the body.Because I sit at a desk at home for many hours a day, I wanted something comfortable to wear (jeans and dress pants are too uncomfortable to sit around in).  These sweatpants do meet that bill, they are comfortable to sit around in.  I would also have expected them to be thicker quality and warm, but they are not.I postponed writing this review until I had washed them.  The instructions say that a 30 degree wash in a machine and a low heat tumble dry is okay.  I am happy to say that I didn't notice any shrinkage.Given that these are comfortable to sit around in at a desk and appear to wash/dry without shrinkage, I decided to keep them.

I am particulrly fussy about comfort and quality in relation to footwear. The flip flops I purchased are excellent quailty and fit. I take a UK10 shoe size. The US equivalent size for men is 11 (M11). The style and shape of these CROC's are really very nice on the foot. I bought the black with a white side strip in the sole. The contact and grip with the feet and floor are very good in that the footwear remains comfortably on the feet and grip the floor surface just about ideally to allow confident non slip walking in or out. The material used in their manufacture is EVA which is a rubber type material which provides many of the benifits of rubber but without the awful smell normally associated with it. The insole of these flip flops have shape to dovetail with the foot and very small dimples which keeps the foot airiated to aliviate swet. The toe post is also quite ideal in that it is not thick or abrasive which would become quite uncomfortable after a few hours wear. This all adds to provide the wearer with all day comfort and footwear that stays on the foot without sticking to the underside of the foot. In my opion, these CROC's are well worth the money anf will provide years of quality wear. My wife has worn CROC slide on's for quite some years and thinks they are one of the best designs of footwear around, particularyly in hot weather too. They go into the washing machine periodically for a wash and always remain intact.

With their impressive comfort, breathability, and warmth, these socks offer a great value for the price.One of the main positives of these socks is their affordability. Compared to other brands in the market, YUEDGE provides a pack of five socks at a reasonable cost without compromising on key features. For those on a budget, this option allows you to stock up on multiple pairs of high-quality socks without breaking the bank.In terms of comfort, these socks excel. The cushioned sole provides a plush and comfortable feel, making them ideal for long walks, athletic activities, or everyday wear. The added cushioning helps reduce foot fatigue, providing support throughout the day. Whether you're on your feet for extended periods or engaged in physical activities, these socks keep your feet comfortable and cozy.The breathability of the socks is another commendable feature. The wicking technology efficiently draws moisture away from the skin, keeping your feet dry and fresh even during intense workouts. This is particularly important in preventing odors and maintaining overall foot hygiene. The breathable design ensures that air circulates freely, enhancing the overall comfort and freshness of your feet.Furthermore, these socks offer excellent warmth, which is particularly beneficial during colder months or in chilly climates. The combination of high-quality materials and thoughtful design helps to insulate your feet, keeping them warm and cozy. This feature makes these socks suitable for outdoor activities or simply lounging around the house on a cold day.However, one downside to note is that these socks may wear out more quickly compared to some higher-end brands I have tried. While they offer great value for the price, the durability of the socks could be improved. With regular use and washing there are signs of wear and tear, particularly in high-friction areas such as the heels. It's important to consider this aspect if you're looking for socks that will withstand heavy use over an extended period.In conclusion, these Socks offer an affordable and comfortable option for everyday wear, athletic activities, and casual outings. The cushioned sole provides excellent comfort and support, while the breathability and warmth ensure a pleasant experience for your feet. While the durability could be better, these socks still offer good value for the price. If you're looking for budget-friendly socks that prioritize comfort and performance, the YUEDGE socks are a solid choice.", "review_title": "Good value and comfortable but durability of the socks could be improved.", "date_written": "2023-05-20", "product_asin": "B07BSZXWWT", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 5, "rating_given": 4.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//YUEDGE-Breathable-Comfortable-Performance-Athletic/product-reviews/B09VF9FF3J?reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "f2121491-6a25-4eac-99b3-fe6d693469d1", "review_ref": "R3GTYYDLKIHEUQ", "product_id": "fe7ddd96-9d52-4721-8e0e-9179ca60aa25", "review_content": "When they are new they are fine and comfy but i noticed after a wash they are shrinking and causing pain in my 9.5 feet feet so i'll have to ditch these i'm afraid", "review_title": "Comfy but shrink in the wash", "date_written": "2024-03-18", "product_asin": "B07BSZXWWT", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 4.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//YUEDGE-Breathable-Comfortable-Performance-Athletic/product-reviews/B09VF9FF3J?reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "10414d33-3d76-481e-8b38-a86ec5ac0681", "review_ref": "R3UMSDHDI28DM9", "product_id": "fe7ddd96-9d52-4721-8e0e-9179ca60aa25", "review_content": "These are for my husband and he really likes them.", "review_title": "Socks", "date_written": "2023-11-14", "product_asin": "B07BSZXWWT", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 4.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//YUEDGE-Breathable-Comfortable-Performance-Athletic/product-reviews/B09VF9FF3J?reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "31d4e305-8479-4170-8a54-335c98395ba2", "review_ref": "R1XBAJ8AW1C9OS", "product_id": "fe7ddd96-9d52-4721-8e0e-9179ca60aa25", "review_content": "I give these 4* because they start off great and really soft and awesome for walking.

As someone who values both comfort and quality in everyday wear, these socks exceeded my expectations in every way possible.Let's talk about comfort. From the moment I slipped my feet into these socks, I could feel the luxurious softness embracing my skin. The material used is incredibly gentle, yet durable, providing a snug fit without feeling restrictive. Whether I'm running errands, working out, or simply lounging at home, these socks provide the perfect balance of cushioning and breathability. Even during long hours of wear, my feet remained dry and comfortable, thanks to the excellent moisture-wicking properties of the fabric.One of the standout features of YUEDGE socks is their ergonomic design. The socks conform perfectly to the contours of my feet, offering support in all the right places. The reinforced heel and toe areas provide extra cushioning and durability, ensuring that these socks are built to last. The seamless toe closure eliminates the discomfort of traditional socks, making them ideal for individuals with sensitive skin or those prone to irritation.What truly sets YUEDGE socks apart is their versatility. Whether I'm wearing sneakers, boots, or casual shoes, these socks fit like a dream. The elasticated cuffs keep them securely in place, preventing annoying slipping or bunching inside my shoes. Plus, they come in a variety of styles and colors, making it easy to find the perfect pair for any outfit or occasion.In addition to their unparalleled comfort, YUEDGE socks are also incredibly easy to care for. They maintain their shape and softness even after multiple washes, a testament to the high-quality craftsmanship and materials used in their production.In conclusion, YUEDGE socks are a true revelation in the world of comfortable footwear. If you're someone who values both coziness and durability, these socks are an absolute must-have. I wholeheartedly recommend YUEDGE socks to anyone seeking the perfect blend of comfort, quality, and style.

I want it to last me for many more years...my previous one (which I still have) was used extensively for over 25 years!  But, for my local daily 'constitutionals' I wanted something a little less 'technical' that would still provide rain cover, not be too heavy, and can be left in the car if necessary without fear of theft...replacement cost has to be low.This jacket fits the bill perfectly.  I am 5' 7\" and ordered the M size.  It fits perfectly...not too long in the arm, and a length that provides good cover over my backside.  I can wear this over a light base layer or several thicker layers...it's plenty roomy without feeling baggy.  The hood compacts well into the collar and while it is not the best, it does have pull cords to tighten it around the head.  I find hoods usually work best over a peaked cap though. The jacket has 4 pockets: two zip pockets outside (R&L), and two pockets on the inside.  The latter pockets have no zips and are more suited to light items like gloves, or maybe even a map.  I wouldn't put a water bottle in them.The seams are well sealed and it provides good rain protection, though I haven't tried it yet in a heavy downpour.  If moisture is felt inside then it is most likely due to condensation from perspiration...the jacket does get quite warm if you're walking at pace, like I tend to.The jacket packs into a small separate draw-string bag, rather than one of its own pockets and this makes an easily stowed lightweight package to carry in another bag or throw in the glove box or door storage in the car.Overall, at one-tenth of the price of my Haglofs jacket, this has become my go-to rain lightweight cover for short walks or car trips.

RockDove is the inventor of the two-tone memory foam slipper, launched in 2017. Please beware of the impostors who steal our content but can't live up to our quality. We thank you for choosing RockDove and supporting original work.      What size should I choose if I wear a half-size?   We suggest going up a size if you wear a half-size or an in-between size (e.g. men's 7.5, 9.5, 10.5). To find your best fitting size, please refer to our size chart which can be found by clicking the size chart link next to the size selection menu.      How do I clean these?   All RockDove slippers are made machine washable. We recommend washing in cold water, gentle cycle and air drying.      I'm a lady and want to buy these. What's the right size for me?   Please use this simple conversion rule: add 1 to the men's size to get the ladies' size. For example, the men's size 8/9 is the same length as the ladies' size 9/10, but slightly wider. We also recommend the RockDove Ladies' Two-Tone Slipper.                   Making feet (and paws) happy since 2002.   Slippers that don't look boring.    That's our goal. The RockDove two-tone slipper is inspired by the vibrant hues of southern California, where we call home. Born with the laid-back vibes of a SoCal beachtown, it's easy to slip on and kick off, with a go-anywhere sole that lets you step out without switching shoes.

To achieve this, we dedicate 100% of our working lives to making slippers and nothing else, nothing to distract us from our craft.         What sets RockDove apart from the rest     Innovation: we experiment with features and fabrics typically reserved for performance footwearEthical Manufacturing: no animal skins used; fair wages and safe conditions for workers (amfori BSCI-audited)Consistent Sizing: every product is fit-tested to standard UK shoe sizing prior to production          Slippers for Frontline Heroes         Throughout 2020, RockDove is giving away slippers to healthcare workers and first responders who are fighting the pandemic on the frontlines. We can't imagine what it feels to be in their shoes, so we're giving them ours -- RockDove memory foam slippers to rest their tired feet after a long shift.          Who We Are     RockDove was created for five birdwatchers of the Los Angeles Audubon Society in 2002. They were our customers, when we weren't yet a slipper company, but a beachside workshop in Santa Monica, California that resoled hiking boots. For fifteen years we protected the feet of avid adventurers as they trekked punishing terrains across southern California's mountains and deserts. As their local shoe cobbler, when customers had footwear needs, they came to us. And over time they asked for something that was badly missing, not in their time conquering the outdoors but in their lives at home\u2014quality indoor shoes to console their high-mileage, trail-weary feet. So for Christmas that year, we made five pairs of slippers for our long-time Audubon customers using a low-cut boot last.   Shoe brands in southern California, where sunny beaches and flip flops rule, don't pay much attention to slippers. So we had little to build on. But we did know how to make comfortable, long lasting footwear. Using mattress memory foam, gel insoles, anti-shock EVA from hiking boots, and more, we designed slippers with the goal of comforting extremely tired feet. Two months later when we sent out a newsletter about our slipper experiment, customers responded with 350 mail orders. We named our slippers after the most common bird we knew, the rock dove (pigeon) often seen strutting the boardwalks of Santa Monica Pier. They\u2019re a memento of where we\u2019re from and what we represent.   To this day our legacy of creating footwear as if for the most exhausted, adventure-wearied feet lives on. But adventure isn\u2019t always hanging on a rope off the side of a mountain. Everyone lives their own version of it, every single day. We make slippers so that anyone who\u2019s on their feet all day\u2014not just passionate outdoorsmen but teachers, chefs, nurses, cashiers, traffic cops, postal workers, and more\u2014can count on switching into the world\u2019s most comfortable slippers once they get home.   Our quest to get comfort down to a science pushed us to become one of the earliest adopters of high-density memory foam in slippers. In 2004, we reached out to local sleep experts at the Long Beach Mattress Company to source their memory foam toppers, which we then moulded into insoles. But mattress comfort didn't exactly translate to slipper comfort. So we obsessively tweaked the density and firmness of our foams to create that \u201csweet spot\u201d level: one that offers incredible comfort, yet not so much cushioning that you\u2019ll feel like walking in quicksand. Today, at the heart of each RockDove slipper is a multilayered foam construction\u2014a 40-70D memory foam that rebounds with every step, a heel insert that adds firmness, and an anti-shock EVA layer.

I was thinking \"why does it seem to be so hard to make a slipper that is nice to wear and lasts more than 5 seconds??\" then I saw these. The marketing ticked all the boxes:Memory foamExtra supportGreat reviewsAnd a premium price tag to back it up.At first they felt lovely. Warm, snug, perfect fit. They had pride of place beside my bed, ready to welcome me in to the morning! And they look great.This lasted all of two nights.As time goes on (and we're talking over 10 days now), I regret buying these even more.I have wide feet, and went down a size rather than up, but after a couple of days they were hanging off my feet.After poking and prodding these slippers the reason becomes obvious:These are not the slippers as advertised.If we are to be generous, they have \"manufacturing issues\", as about half of the slipper isn't there. And what is, is not made from the materials advertised.The memory foam in particular is featured as \"rebounds in 2 seconds\". Spoiler alert: they don't. Not even after being left overnight.There is a helpful diagram under \"The Proof is in the Cushioning\". It's very clear that these are made with 6 components.However, only 2 of those appear to be intact, and only one is as described.Let's to the run down:1. Breathable Waffle Knit UpperPresent and correct. So we know it's the correct product as this is the outside, so hard to mess this one up. Even has the \"Back Heel Collar\"2. 360 Degree Memory Foam [1/4 inch]Also there! Again, you'd notice quickly if the slipper was just a scrap of fabric. Not quite confinced it's memory foam, and not sure if it's \"360\" [can't check the presence of this without a pair of scissors]. However, it just feels like standard foam.3. DoveFoam memory foam layer [1/2 inch]*Might* be present, or might just be the bottom of #2. However, this is not memory foam as advertised. It collapsed within 3 days (thus falling off my feet).4. Half Inch Heel Cushion [1/2 inch]Probably missing. This one's easy to check - the inside is sewn straight, and the heel is a quarter inch higher than the rest of the slipper. It's either not in there, or thinner than advertised. Either way, it collapsed within days and I may as well be walking on the floor.5. EVA Layer [1/4 inch]Missing. Pinch through the collapsed heel and by golly, all one feels is the tiny space in there for the rubber sole.6. Rubber Outsole [1/8 inch]Not very rubbery, feeling more like plastic and giving very little grip. Again, you'd think it difficult to mess this one up as it'd be quite obvious if it were missing. However, with some more pinching, what do you know - even this is incomplete. It comes in at zero arch support, and the \"spiky massager\" is not present.For those keeping score at home, these behemoths of slippers should be more than 1.5 inches thick at the heels!With 1.25 inches of memory foam at the heel alone. Instead they are about 3/4 thick, and maybe 1/2 an inch of standard foam.At this price point you don't expect perfect, but do expect something extra that will last longer than it takes for the recycling bin to be collected.These can easily be replaced with two pairs of sports socks and cheap sandals.Get the cheap ones, they'll probably last longer.", "review_title": "Generously has \"manufacturing issues\"", "date_written": "2021-01-25", "product_asin": "B01MR34D28", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 1, "rating_given": 2.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//RockDove-Original-Two-Tone-Memory-Slipper/product-reviews/B0B8BLLC3C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "907a98f2-707f-4e38-bcc8-98b119b4318e", "review_ref": "R1TSCTYHLAAPB7", "product_id": "f85ed4d2-65d1-4b49-9751-dd8c7df327c2", "review_content": "Don't  fit well, slob off my feet.", "review_title": "Slippers", "date_written": "2024-03-18", "product_asin": "B01MR34D28", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 2.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//RockDove-Original-Two-Tone-Memory-Slipper/product-reviews/B0B8BLLC3C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "cd2a0109-b368-4eec-bd29-c57bd6a8d7af", "review_ref": "R1290YHTDOWYSN", "product_id": "f85ed4d2-65d1-4b49-9751-dd8c7df327c2", "review_content": "They look good in the advertising but quality is poor.

They looked smart, were lightweight and had a good footbed and sole. A solid 5 star review was on the cards.However, the more I wore them the more the memory foam forgot that it was supposed to recover and the flatter the footbed became. This meant that not only did they become less comfortable but you could feel any and every lump or gap you trod on, and they became harder to keep on one's foot. Finally they started slipping off when going up or down stairs and creating their own slip hazard - eventually causing me to fall (luckily) when going up the stairs.I really wanted to like these, but in the end I returned them, and am now looking for a replacement.CUSTOMER SERVICE: Worth 5 StarsI must add a note about their customer services. After I had returned these (and received a refund) I got a message from Rock Dove apologising that I had had problems with their slippers and offering to refund the purchase price.

The open back, slip-on style allows for easy on and off, and the fitted upper and back lip help to prevent the slipper from flopping off my foot, especially when walking down stairs. The memory foam insole is incredibly comfortable and moulds to the contours of my foot for pillow-soft comfort. I've been wearing these slippers after long days at work and my feet feel so much better after a few hours in them.One of the things I appreciate most about these slippers is the breathable waffle-knit upper. It helps to avoid sweaty feet and keeps my toes dry and odourless. The material is also 100% vegan and machine washable, which is a nice bonus. The rubber sole with anti-slip traction is also a great feature. It allows me to step outside the house to grab the mail or walk the dog without worrying about slipping.However, I have noticed several issues with these slippers. Firstly, the sizing seems to be inconsistent. I needed to go up a size for a comfortable fit, especially if you have wide feet, but some users have found the slippers to be too small while others have found them to be too large, even when ordering their usual shoe size. It's important to carefully refer to the size chart and possibly go up a size if you have wide feet.Additionally, the memory foam quickly loses its firmness and support, leading to the slippers feeling like walking on a hard, carpeted floor. The soles of the slippers have also been a problem, with the bobbly textured finish shedding tiny bits of rubber onto the floor and requiring the use of tape to stop the shedding.I have also found that these slippers are not very durable. The memory foam started to lose its firmness within a week of wear, and some users have reported that the slippers are not worth the money, feeling that they are overpriced for the quality.Overall, while these memory foam slippers are comfortable, they have several issues that may make them less appealing to some users. It's important to keep these points in mind when considering a purchase.", "review_title": "You just give it a try", "date_written": "2022-12-31", "product_asin": "B01MR34D28", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 20, "rating_given": 3.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//RockDove-Original-Two-Tone-Memory-Slipper/product-reviews/B0B8BLLC3C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=three_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "f59c9a23-f944-4821-8a07-3fc1b920e5a6", "review_ref": "R3M4X0QVI6KO19", "product_id": "f85ed4d2-65d1-4b49-9751-dd8c7df327c2", "review_content": "Really liked these when I first got them.

The cushioning is so plush and supportive that I find myself wearing these slippers not only around the house but also when I step outside to grab the mail or take out the trash. They really have helped with some of the plantar fasciitis that I've been dealing with. And since they are plush, but also pretty breathable, I wear them often even when it is a warm day.Another feature I appreciate is the easy on-and-off design. The backless style means I can slide my feet in and out effortlessly, which is super convenient. I have another pair of slippers that I just don't use because they are less slip on and more like putting on a shoe. And even with the low back, the slippers don't just fall off your feet.In terms of sizing, I found that they fit true to size, and the size chart provided by RockDove was accurate. I have size 15 feet and these fit without complaints out of the box.These are some great slippers and I do recommend them. They feel good and they don't look lame like some house slippers do.

I have the Navy chenille one. I found them to be the best slippers I had ever bought. I purchased another pair that I only wore while I washed my navy one, again they were the chenille one in a different colour. Now once my nave once were dry I put the others away . I noticed the ones I had not worn very often were coming apart I contacted Rockdove who replaced without hesitation I couldn\u2019t have asked for better service. My husband started to moan about something rubbing on his foot at the side where he put shoes on, then he actually admitted it was a build up of hard skin, and the leather slippers that he recently wanted was also hurting him. Being the sympathetic wife that I am ( not ) lol \ud83d\ude02 I did say well if you know it\u2019s a build up of hard skin then you hsd best do something about it then hadn\u2019t you. All our married life I had sorted everything out so if he thought I was going to sort his hard skin problem he would be waiting a extremely long long time. After listening to him moan for a another month or so he still had not done anything about it. I bought him a pair of the Rockdove slippers. He absolutely loves them he tell me something I already know is how very very comfortable they are. He also told me they didn\u2019t rub on the hard skin. I purchased the 9.5 slip on ones. Him being a size 9 I wasn\u2019t sure if the ones sized 8/9 would be big enough. It turned out the 9.5 are a little too big. Not that he\u2019s ever moaned at me for getting the 9.5. I then asked him for his Rockdove slippers to wash. All I got was what am I going to wear. I said surly you can mange one day in the leather ones you wanted prior to me buying you a pair of Rockdove. So me being me such a loving and thoughtful wife that I am I say with a deep sigh. I thought I can not put my dearest husband in pain again. Having asked if he had done anything about his hard skin problem. Hence my sympathetic self ( kicked in not ) I again told him he should hurry up and get it sorted so I as any loving wife would do sigh..... sent for him another pair of Rockdove slippers for him because no matter what I can not fault his words about then being the most comfortable pair of slippers either of us had ever had. Also at such a reasonable price this time with the 9.5 being a little big I thought I would get him the size down so I purchased the size 8/9 when they came yesterday he was delighted I had purchased him another pair of the Rockdove slippers. However these are a little on the small size. Now although I will continue to purchase Rockdove slippers for my husband and I what I would say. Why do any and I mean any have duel sizing on slip on slippers. ?????????? Why. My husband is a standard size 9 he\u2019s not awkward in anyway that he can walk into any shop pick up a size 9 shoe and they fit. I can take him to were I buy his really expensive shoes from buy a size 9 they fit. In fact he doesn\u2019t come shopping for shoes for himself. He leaves that to me otherwise he would gulp at the prices. I have always bought real leather with leather soles and heels. Feet are a thing I personally think should be looked after from birth. People like my mum as a example didn\u2019t really bother as they didn\u2019t much those days if you could get them on then they fitted. Causing lots of people to suffer as they get older. Oops apologies. Going back to slip on slippers Rockdove you are the original manufacturer of these types of slippers I see many copies who I personally would not recommend. But this is one time I have to say the slip one duel sizes as in size 8/9 are a tad to small a 9.5 are a tad too big leaving me a little frustrated. He loves your slippers for comfort quality he likes the slip on ones. It would be nice to be able to buy in single sizes were I know and I am sure other would too that they are actually a proper fit. For the first time I am not leaving a 5 star rating due to slip on sizing issues.", "review_title": "Rockdove are the original manufacturers of the memory foam slippers so why buy copies", "date_written": "2020-08-05", "product_asin": "B01MR34D28", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 7, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//RockDove-Original-Two-Tone-Memory-Slipper/product-reviews/B0B8BLLC3C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "904b8e73-e723-4457-858b-aeac41f8f0a5", "review_ref": "RI9S5FD4FBRV1", "product_id": "f85ed4d2-65d1-4b49-9751-dd8c7df327c2", "review_content": "You know you're getting old when you buy your husband slippers for his birthday.

Frequent \u2018adjustment of the Crown Jewels\u2019 is still needed with the Aussie trunks, adjustment is  rarely if ever needed with the Danish. Plus the Aussie version actually don\u2019t really look any better or appear more durable, but they are more than 3 times the price per pair. My advice through my personal experience is don\u2019t waste your money, because that is what you will be doing, just go for the Danish Endurance. All my M&S underwear and the Aussie bamboo trunks are now completely redundant. With the superb comfort of the Danish Endurance bamboo boxers, I now see no point in compromising this comfort.

Didn't hear a rip nor notice it, so I assume it emerged over a few days.These are my go-to jeans.  I'm middle aged so I'm not cut out for skinny jeans, nor do I like them but I do like a fir which hugs the body and these fit the bill.  Most importantly, these STRETCH.  This gives so much more comfort.  i was bought a pair as a gift a few years ago and I haven't looked back.  They are a bit tight at first, but they get a little more slack and stretch more as they are worn in.  They take on a quality of their own.

I've worn these shoes hiking through streams and up rocky trails, and they've held up perfectly.Finally, I love the versatility of these clogs. They come in a variety of colors that can be dressed up or down, making them perfect for any occasion. Whether I'm running errands in leggings and a t-shirt or dressing up for a casual dinner with friends, these shoes always look great.Overall, I can confidently say that the Crocs Unisex's Crocband Clogs are some of the best shoes I've ever owned.

SIZE GUIDE                             SIZE CHART   Measurements are desired standards, some variability may occur.       HOW TO MEASURE   FOOT: We start with the true foot, which means we measure from heel to toe. That measurement (in centimeters) is then translated into our standard sizes.   To find your foot measurement closely trace your entire foot onto a piece of paper and measure from heel to toe. If your measurement is between chart numbers, we recommend sizing up. Be sure you\u2019re putting your full weight on your foot while tracing. Please note: for the best results, measuring later in the day is recommended.   We created this easy-to-use sizing chart so that finding the right size shoes for your kids won\u2019t be a workout in itself. *Due to the metric/imperial conversions, there will be some instances where two US sizes will equal one UK size or one CM size.

So, in theory, this should last quite a while.* It\u2019s only been two days since I last used it, but we have had rain, sun and thunderstorms. These conditions are an issue, particularly if it becomes sunny as condensation builds up, this making motion detection useless and having to wipe down constantly. Since using this, I haven\u2019t had to do either, and the image remains clean of debris and condensation is primarily purchased and what I wanted it to do.Con:* If you\u2019re going to use it with a Ring, I thought it could spray and allow it to dry naturally, Don\u2019t do this. I tried, and it left a red residue behind in some areas (although the liquid was clear). It took quite a few damp cloths cleaning and buffing to remove. Ensure when you spray, you immediately wipe.* Having read some of the reviews regarding smell, I can confirm it does have a scent. To me, it smells like boiled eggs, so not ideal if you intend to use it on glasses as you\u2019ll be able to pick up on this. It isn\u2019t an issue for me personally due to solely for outdoor use. My partner did use it on their glasses but found the scent disgusting and lingered; therefore, they had to use liquid detergent to remove it.Overall, I would recommend if you're using outside on a ring doorbell or similar on glasses, probably not so much due to the smell.

At times it would be fine on one lens and do nothing for another, and other times it just ends up preventing the steam but instead making your glasses look like they're coated with a wet, oily residue - making it similarly hard to see (although admittedly not as hard as with mist).I've tried various other means (using more/ less than the instructions suggest) and just can't seem to get it to work with any real consistency. At times it seemingly does nothing, at others it works to a reasonable degree and other times it essentially replaces one problem with another.

Came across these new balance ones and this review sites along side my second purchase which tells you strisght away I was happy with them.  By far the most comfy boxers I've had in years, if not ever.  No riding up and that's genuine, for me at least.  I appreciate we might all be off different shapes and sizes but striaght away these made me realise how poor the NEXT and alike really are.  I get no movement throughout the day which is a massive difference, especially when your in the middle of Tesco trying to right a few wrongs.  Very awkward.  The material is of a small amount of lycra.  This makes them very comfy and keeps the shape really well.  I wouldn't normally wear new balance for a night out but for the fact they are so comfy I've got a pair of the pure black version which are perfect.

But I\u2019m in the gym 6 days a week, and so my large quads and butt reflect all those squats and hip thrusts. Herein begins the endless search for the perfect undergarment that provides support, but also prevents any chafing, and stays put even during the sweatiest training session or long walk.Boys, I think I\u2019ve found them!Hands down these are better than the Under Armour equivalent that we all know about. The under UA pairs I\u2019ve had all ride up, every day, all the way up until I might as well have worn tiny briefs instead.But not these! No! These are light weight - but not too sheer, supportive - but not compressing, and best of all, even on my solid legs, they stay put. Even after a sweaty walk to the gym, a gruelling leg day (with lots of friction from hip thrusts, RDLs, squats, and some elliptical machine at the end. They mostly stayed completely put, only shifting up a slight amount on my legs100% when I do the same kinds of workout in UA equivalent, it\u2019s Roll city.I could probably squeeze my assets into a large, but I got these in XL and they are a really a good fit - if you have seriously large quads and glutes, get a XL. But large could probably work as well, depends on your wait measurement. Sometimes if you go too small in the waist side, you can fit into them, but then the waist band constantly rolls and folds over - another pet hate of mine.I held these New Balance XL up against the UA equivalent in XL, and these New Balance ones are about 1inch smaller, in the waist. So they are a slightly smaller fit.Can\u2019t really fault them so far, and they are better value for money than the UA ones.Also, not that everyone is interested, but these have seams/stitch that comes up the back of the pants on both sides of your behind, and for some reason it provides a kind of extra lift. Makes your arse look better.

Seriously, I kid you not, it's a very presentable, well built looking wee thing.I bought the 36mm model and it sits nicely on my 5\u215b inch wrist.The cashback is undoubtedly made of a decent chunk of actual stainless steel whereas many similarly budget minded watches come with some form of nasty zinc alloy that burns the skin as soon as they're worn for more than a few seconds.My picture showing the rear case shows how crisply the lettering and numbers are formed. This suggests that this watch is far from the cheaply assembled piece of nonsensical junk more often found at this very inexpensive end of the analogue watch range available.The strap is also far better than I expected it to be.I'm impressed that said strap is honestly and openly described as  a leather alternative, where many budget pieces are described as real leather.Not only is the strap correctly, truthfully described but, as you will see if you zoom in on the photo that shows the outer finish on the strap, [the strap] looks, wears and feels like a much more expensive one.So far, the watch is keeping excellent time, as a quartz piece should. Sadly not all quartz movements are so accurate, some of my similarly inexpensive quartz pieces lose seconds per day.There is no minute track on the straightforward, uncluttered dial of this watch, so to check its accuracy precisely it is best set at 12 o'clock when you have it out of the packet and are getting it ready to go.(Slight) criticisms as follow:The crown is very light to turn and can cause the minute hand to move when you're pushing said crown in after setting the time. This is easily dealt with by simply ensuring that it is pushed home with a fingertip at either edge of the crown and keeping your fingers from moving, so preventing unwanted moving of the hands.For me, this is no problem at all, indeed I can think of a certain Swiss \"luxury\" watch in my collection that does exactly the same thing. It's not a fault, simply a characteristic and not indicative of any manufacturing problem - I couldn't find any of those and was trying!Sum up:A good looking, surprisingly well built watch for a lower cost than a new battery for many quartz watches.Parti ularly impressive for me are the quality of manufacture in both rear cover and strap.This is a real bargain and very far from a hastily thrown together piece of the sort that looks and most frequently is poorly made.Well done to the makers of this for supplying a watch that's actually rather good! I may add another colourway to the collection.Thanks for reading, I hope that my words & pictures have been useful.Happy shopping,Jaye \u00d7\u00d7", "review_title": "Amazing for the price!", "date_written": "2023-10-14", "product_asin": "B004LXWRH6", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 20, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//Ravel-Black-Strap-Unisex-R0105-07-1/product-reviews/B004LXWRH6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "06988928-c793-41ab-afd8-c8c3b8227f5f", "review_ref": "R32RIECE4PNDNZ", "product_id": "73f3c19a-145f-4ac6-b88b-211075035c97", "review_content": "Brilliant for the price and very clear to see", "review_title": "Brilliant", "date_written": "2024-02-26", "product_asin": "B004LXWRH6", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//Ravel-Black-Strap-Unisex-R0105-07-1/product-reviews/B004LXWRH6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "9b59e82e-fced-4328-ae8c-7c57290a7ce4", "review_ref": "R1Y4Y9P3KQ5UW5", "product_id": "73f3c19a-145f-4ac6-b88b-211075035c97", "review_content": "Nice watch, easy to read, Very good value for money.", "review_title": "Simples", "date_written": "2024-02-10", "product_asin": "B004LXWRH6", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//Ravel-Black-Strap-Unisex-R0105-07-1/product-reviews/B004LXWRH6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "512d6684-aadd-49fc-8614-154021b60be0", "review_ref": "R2FPBE0YPRQ206", "product_id": "73f3c19a-145f-4ac6-b88b-211075035c97", "review_content": "Second one of this make of watches I have bought and has great battery life.Would not hesitate to recommend", "review_title": "Great value for money", "date_written": "2024-03-25", "product_asin": "B004LXWRH6", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//Ravel-Black-Strap-Unisex-R0105-07-1/product-reviews/B004LXWRH6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "4940eba6-a3d2-4987-ac33-7624d9bf15d6", "review_ref": "RU88O43YRY6O9", "product_id": "73f3c19a-145f-4ac6-b88b-211075035c97", "review_content": "I sent for this watch as my old one had run out of battery and I couldn\u2019t get anywhere to get another one fitted .

Well, simply put, I can\u2019t use these glasses\u2026 The reason is because they are too narrow, they only measure 14 cm from hinge to hinge and although the legs will tilt outwards on springed hinges the springs are too soft, therefore, the glasses won\u2019t grip or even stay on; when I\u2019m walking they slide down my nose with every step. Or if put them on top of my head they slip off, both forwards or backwards, depending on which way I lean.Therefore, either way I wear these glasses, on my face or perched on my head, they fall off when I move and in just one day I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve had to catch them. So, for me, they are useless which is a shame because I liked everything else about them.I\u2019d suggest buying these glasses only if you have a small to medium sized head.(Last observation: I bought the blue mirrored lens version, and the photo of the model wearing them shows a gap between the sunglasses\u2019 legs and the side of his head, there\u2019s a shadow there, but on my pair there\u2019s no space at all between the legs and my temples, the legs press against the sides of my head along there whole length).", "review_title": "Too small, won't stay on - blue mirrored version", "date_written": "2018-02-16", "product_asin": "B01B1D12B0", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 4, "rating_given": 2.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//ATTCL-Driving-Polarized-Sunglasses-18587black/product-reviews/B01B1D12B0/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "e0ce5906-ea26-46ce-9316-1e2a116f8acc", "review_ref": "R1L7EGZIXZFBOE", "product_id": "96f87d3b-5202-4ada-8b60-a1326719302f", "review_content": "I have had numerous pairs of sunglasses from this seller over the years, unfortunately this pair broke just outside of the returns window, arm has become loose", "review_title": "Arm became loose after only 2 weeks", "date_written": "2023-09-05", "product_asin": "B01B1D12B0", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 2.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//ATTCL-Driving-Polarized-Sunglasses-18587black/product-reviews/B01B1D12B0/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "d416165f-c63d-430c-99ca-44e913eddd50", "review_ref": "R3DREISUHJBMA5", "product_id": "96f87d3b-5202-4ada-8b60-a1326719302f", "review_content": "Comfortable and light.

The whole frame is metal (but I'm not sure what type, maybe magnesium?) and they aren't too heavy, they just feel substantial. For this price you can't go wrong.I have the red pair, and although on the pictures you can't see through the guys lenses; if light passes between your eye and the frame then people can see your eyes but that's no problem. These lenses aren't quite as dark as some which is a good thing; and they really do a great job of taking glare away from light sources and making your vision crystal clear.I'd say I have a medium sized head and these fit me perfectly. Also, the nose pads are adjustable if you apply the right amount of pressure and bend them. This probably isn't the correct way to do this though as you may break them off if you do it too often. In other reviews they have said theirs came with a small screwdriver but mine did not. Not a problem though as all the screws are tiny + screws, to which I have many a driver for.Another thing to note is the case and presentation upon opening the package. I was very impressed and the \"softish\" hard case that come with them is also a bonus, will surely help to keep them in good condition but the case wont take too much stress. Then again the case will not fit in your back pocket so no chance of sitting on them.All in all, brilliant for the price. I may get a second pair and I'd highly recommend them.Let me know if this was helpful, my first short review..

I particularly like the alloy on my old ones. I'm still using them for driving.So I wanted a different style, and an alloy frame, and came back for another pair.I recieved these last week. While I've not had chance to use them in the correct environment (because UK weather), I have worn them to see how they are:They are dark - I mean, very dark; which for my intended use - going abroad in the sun - is perfect. They are a tad bit small initially putting them on my head, but I have a big head that's no big deal - they are comfortable when worn though. The alloy frame makes them feel really well made; they're a bit heavier than full plastic ones but I don't find it compromises comfort.They're honestly great all-round.I think I'll just check out ATTCL ones first in the future should I need another pair instead of trying others and being disappointed.", "review_title": "Great all-round", "date_written": "2023-03-27", "product_asin": "B01B1D12B0", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 3, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//ATTCL-Driving-Polarized-Sunglasses-18587black/product-reviews/B01B1D12B0/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "40d513f6-5854-4bcc-867e-5e84552c23e9", "review_ref": "RDM74MFWGDLX6", "product_id": "96f87d3b-5202-4ada-8b60-a1326719302f", "review_content": "Solid all metal build.

They don't make a lot of sound even when running. They feel like a toned down version of walking on clouds.These shoes are great for standing for long periods, hiking, running, sports... I do not recommend them for cycling because the soles will just get torn up by metal pedals like mine did.I even took these backpacking.

Luckily my 'Under Armour' T-Shirt (expensive!) was turned inside-out, so the red dye only went on the reverse side. The worst thing about these though is that the mesh lining inside is a little bit loose. A few times, my 'under-carriage' popped onto the side through the mesh lining and anyone passing in front of me, could get a glimpse of my gonads (sorry). So constant 'adjustments' needed to be made to keep things from falling to the side, so to speak! Anyway, if they manage to sort out the over-dye problem (it is a vivid colour) and reinforce the mesh-lining inside, they'd have a better product.

However, my quest for comfortable and supportive shoes took a positive turn when I discovered the Under Armour pair that has truly been a game-changer.Comfort and Fit: These shoes instantly impressed me with their impeccable comfort and ideal fit. As someone with larger feet, it's often frustrating to find shoes that feel just right, but these exceeded my expectations. The cushioning and padding inside create a cloud-like sensation, making each step a delight. No matter how long I wear them, I haven't experienced any discomfort, thanks to their well-designed fit.Arch Support: The standout feature of these shoes, particularly for individuals with fallen arches, is the exceptional arch support they offer. The design of the Under Armour shoes effectively cradles the feet and provides much-needed stability. This support has significantly reduced the strain on my arches, granting me relief I didn't think was possible from a pair of shoes.Durability: Beyond the immediate comfort and support, these shoes have showcased remarkable durability. Despite my active lifestyle and frequent use, they have held up incredibly well. The choice of high-quality materials in their construction gives me confidence that they'll continue to be a reliable companion for a long time, solidifying the value of this investment.Style: While the primary focus is on comfort and support, these shoes don't compromise on style either. With a modern and sleek design, they effortlessly complement various casual outfits. While not the flashiest option, they strike a balance between aesthetics and functionality.In conclusion, the Under Armour shoes tailored for larger feet and fallen arches have proven to be a godsend for me.

However, I have tried them on in the house, and taken a shower wearing them to see how they coped in water.First off, these are pretty much a standard design for excellent but cheap water shoes. Next, they do have drainage holes (which you don't always get) which makes using them for paddle boarding (my main reason for owning these types of shoes) a much more enjoyable experience. They are also made with not too much cushioning (which makes them dry quicker, no one wants damp shoes to wear the next day), which again can be an issue with other types of water shoes I have tried. They have a good rubber sole which will be handy for wet rocks, etc. They also have a tab on the tongue to help you pull them on and off your feet which is helpful when they are wet. They are good value for money, at the time of review in March 2023, they are \u00a324.99. How robust they are, remains to be seen though.The only reason I have given 4 stars and not 5 stars, is that the sizing is way out. I would recommend you go a size smaller than you think.

It stretches enough (a blessing for someone that has large hands), is easily adjustable and looks like it'll last - even if not, they're cheap enough to buy a couple of replacements after a year or two.The downside is the metal bars supplied with the straps. For the first couple of days, the bar would come loose from the watch - luckily for me, while I was at my desk or adjusting it. It did once come loose while I was sleeping too. The bars seems to be long enough, but I mean, we're talking millimeters, so I may be wrong on that.I cut a bar out from my old silicone watch strap and tried that in this strap, lo-and-behold, the strap no longer becomes loose at the first sign of adjustment or smallest amount of pressure.So what that probably means is the spring in the supplied bars are too light or maybe they're a mm or so too short. It wasn't just one bar that was the problem, you're supplied with 8 (or at least I was). I tried 4 different ones and they all would come loose easily.Would I buy these again?

Standard boxers give no support whereas fitted types (like these) should keep things where they need to be, whatever the wearer is doing.I read the reviews and decided to buy them XL, which is standard for me.  But really they're not supportive enough, in the XL size, so maybe I should have gone for L instead.  Or maybe Danish athletes are sized differently.  They seem to have washed well but in my case I have to rearrange the furniture too often.

How to find the right shoe size?                              Why is this important?   Shoe sizes are not standardized. Every shoe manufacturer uses different measurements in terms of instep height, toe shape and foot width. However, the basis for your own shoe size is always the length of your feet. Thus, you should always determine your foot length before buying in order to choose the right shoe.       Step 1: tracing your feet   Take off your socks, place a piece of paper against a wall, and place your foot on it so that your heel touches the wall. Now use a pen to trace the shape of the foot on the front of the toes. Hold the pen exactly upright.   Important: Both feet must be measured, as they are often of different lengths! Feet often swell during the day, which is why we recommend taking the measurement in the late afternoon.       Step 2: measure   Now you can measure the edge of the paper from where the heel was to the longest toe and determine the length of your foot. Use your longer foot as a guidance. We calculated the necessary allowance for enough space in the shoe for you. Find the size that fits your foot length and the allowance included in our shoe size table to make the right choice.             Step 3: Look it up in the shoe size table       ", "revised_description": null, "product_asin": "B077MG7LKQ", "overall_ratings": 4.5, "total_customers_that_rated": 39005, "price": 33.99, "currency": "\u00a3", "category": "Fashion", "sub_category": "Men's Fashion", "product_page_url": "https://amazon.co.uk/PUMA-Unisex-Smash-Trainers-Silver/dp/B077MG7LKQ/ref=sr_1_221?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Nh0gkThlUe1uRd2U6noIiVgsNSKbkZEvhtQR-2bjIk4HFF-VOUk1xTg7yBZuv73H4ggxuwbV6esW1mkaritheo4xt2Ych3GtWJqIrGyUSMc3jNNVhkDbzJIfkOSwCcPMQbmFSO1FG06S_A_qNKfdTdnrHUd3dLvw_Pu3vAUXOePS_DVlZbNrDA-T8nhsi1Rk-5hyWn6Yxp_PR8NI0HcLyOPMmB5s5gcSiwZxJ9v55eUAceLxASgfR-M0tvc4cdqvhGQRstkSKdeW2hp-b0qHtPzawbr_Ll54RJft3qd8AQI.-JIHDvxnPhK_VzpQLnCbEPAeQD5m0XJ8T7WlPqNObdk&dib_tag=se&qid=1710844379&s=apparel&sr=1-221", "image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511zR2IZWjL._AC_UL960_QL65_.jpg", "reviews": [{"id": "ff395822-1a13-4b17-a1ca-30e45872bb27", "review_ref": "R2UYBQX1N75NU2", "product_id": "03e2d8cf-623a-4794-93ff-e588f3f49cb3", "review_content": "Wore them sporadically for a couple of months and both soles now have holes right through from the ground to your heel.

They were available at a great price too so I took the chance and bought them. I checked them over before giving them to my dad as a present.

My dad\u2019s had the trainers a little while now and wears them daily. He said they\u2019re so comfortable, lightweight and easy to clean.

Ultimately customers spend time researching the product they wish to buy, sometimes briefly but sometimes for hours or days and then they spend the money they have earnt to get the item.It simply wastes everyones time if you constantly have to send things back to get different sizes. The website gives a size guide but numerous reviews say the company sizes too small.To this end I deliberately ordered two sizes too big and they still were not even close to being wearable. How very frustrating. I get that some nations have different demographics and therefore a company based in Thailand or Sri Lanka may sell predominantly more smaller sizes than a company based in North America however that does not change how many inches are in a foot or centimetres there are in a metre. If your size guide says should fit a size of waste 42inches then that's what it should fit.Large does not necessarily mean overweight we have entire rugby teams to demonstrate that so if you make something you brand as \u201cfor athletes\u201dand they cannot get a leg through one of the holes then you are likely doing something wrong!The product looked great and I was excited to receive it and then it came and I basically wished I hadn't wasted my time and sent it back for refund as I already had the largest size that you had available and my children would have struggled to get into them.

My favourites were unavailable at the time, so I had to resort to looking around for an alternative.  These popped up and seemed really good. Looked the part, slightly smaller in height (not a problem, I am a short dude) so took the plunge.When they arrived I tried a pair.  I'd been aware that they had to size up - I usually buy L/XL for most things, so I'd ordered XXL.  Perfect fit.  They were the right height for my 5'7\" body, even with my slightly chubby belly.  Great.  10/10 for comfort and fit.The only downside so far?  They weren't particularly obvious which side was the front - being ALL BLUE and stitched very similarly front and rear...  But they worked.  Comfortable and snug.A week later, one pair had started separating at the seam on the waist elastic.  A couple of weeks later, two more pairs had started to do the same.  A handful of pairs had already started to split/separate in the base of the crotch area.Now, months later, only ONE pair out of the six are actually whole.  The rest have been discarded into recycling.  My usual favourites (Under Armour Cotton Charged) are much better.  Of the three I ordered in 2020, 2 pairs are still going (just).  Out of the 6 pairs of these I ordered in 2021, 1 pair is barely hanging on.So the conclusion:  Fantastic comfort, would buy again in a heartbeat if it weren't for the fact these are really poor with quality control.  Stitching and fabric wear is a big problem with these.  So it's a middling review, because of the hugely polarised pro and con to them.Caveat: I walk for my job - doing a large amount of miles per week, plus riding a motorbike, so my wear-through rate is probably a lot higher.  That said, the Under Armour's success at not falling apart at the sight of my working day wins over these Danish \"Endurance\"... which they don't.

It's loose, feels flimsy and just not done very well. The problem with this is that it can easily allow things to get hooked on and damage the stitching.Another issue is the little loop for the thinner part of the tie to slide in to keep it tidy suffers the same issue, but the loop itself has a lot of material flaring out and a lot of loose threads. Again, just not very good in quality.\u00a35.99 for a tie is pretty good, and this being in a colour I really like, I honestly wanted to praise it, but unfortunately the quality is subpar and not quite up to the standard I expected.

Now I see why! I looked into the size chart which said that size UK 5 will be my usual EU 39 so ordered them but they are tiny, and would fit at most a 37-38. This is super confusing as this is shown as the brazilian sizing, and next to it it says this equals to EU 39-40. So I see you should either look at the brazilian size as your EU size, or just assume that the brazilian sizing runs 2 sizes small. So I had to reorder a larger size which equals to a EU 41/42, which more or less fits, but slightly large... I would much more prefer if they did individual sizing as only having a choice of 2 sizes up or down is quite ridiculous, especially for such a large company like Havaianas, they should feel embarrassed. I really hope they will do something with the sizing as I love that they make non toxic flip flops from natural rubber that actually look good in comparison to other natural brands which are super ugly.Also another negative point..... those \"bobs\" at the bottom of the sole are so badly cut out that they hardly fit into it and I tried to force it and it still kind of sticks out...

There is enclosed a long list, on a small card, of 21 activities, which the sandals are suitable for - including walking, cycling, golf, & swimming - but not for bobsleighing, before anyone asks! These are of a strong build quality, & a good fit across the instep; & leave a generous gap of around 3cm, front & rear, which I require as a buffer zone for my toes & heals (my normal size is UK 9.) CONCLUSION: Recommended on quality for the price. If, like myself, you can be a bit clumsy, with a long history of broken crockery and glasses; and I  never want to walk again into an abandoned wooden pallet - in flip flops, - I also recommend your choosing your usual shoe size, as a generous fit, or one size up! \u2757 UPDATE: mid-July 2023. I have sunk into the sole of the sandals, as per the shape of my feet. I recently saw a young man  in a park in Nike sliders, who had sunk further into his, than I; likely, he paid a lot more for his! *In comparison, the chunky Mrs has not sunk into her genuine CROCS (See my Review.) They were on offer; and I ordered a pair of unattractive White ones, on price, and minus the badge, but they were waaaay too big, even with socks on. So, I recommend the CROCS, if on offer, and if you order one size up, which worked for her. If on a firm budget, seems only the company name is the difference with the competition. The Mrs is very pleased with her CROCS, so, then, I am not subject to her kicking them off in my direction!", "review_title": "High quality, good fit, & value - ADIDAS Quality!", "date_written": "2023-07-02", "product_asin": "B07FJ78GBC", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 2, "rating_given": 4.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//adidas-Unisexs-Adilette-Slide-Sandal/product-reviews/B0CYM6SR5F/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "c3ad702e-fb48-4d1a-ad6f-8d9d79acd007", "review_ref": "RHE699R91ZZAC", "product_id": "9c53c265-8aba-4354-a5c3-6736ac19ef20", "review_content": "Look nice and comfortable", "review_title": "Adidas sliders", "date_written": "2024-03-06", "product_asin": "B07FJ78GBC", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 4.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//adidas-Unisexs-Adilette-Slide-Sandal/product-reviews/B0CYM6SR5F/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "11144a7f-d68f-450e-8ee4-9999ac11b017", "review_ref": "R34XNN04EJZGEU", "product_id": "9c53c265-8aba-4354-a5c3-6736ac19ef20", "review_content": "A little on the smaller side.

What I received was labelled UK 9! Ignore the guide! Even then the \u2018size 9\u2019 I received was enormous - way bigger - I\u2019ve worn 9s before for the width, but this had over an inch of extra length. I\u2019d say it seemed like a 10 at least.The shoe design, was a disappointment. the construction was very lightweight. It was not what I expected at all, more of a glorified slipper. Not a shoe I would wear outdoors. The sole was flat, with minimal grip, more like an espadrille or a slipper. up close it looked cheap.  For \u00a360 I expected more than a plimsole.The price is way too much for a pair of shoes that I would only wear indoors. Luckily I ordered \u201ctry before you buy\u201d.

My father has blood flow issues and a few other problems that cause his feet and ankles to swell.  The top of his foot doesn\u2019t allow the straps on these shoes to even go in the direction they are supposed to.  Given he has issues with his feet\u2026 I was hoping these would work for him due to the description.  He also stated how hard they felt when he stood up\u2026.So overall these left me still looking for some shoe that he can wear around comfortably.  However, they are built ok from what I can see\u2026 the Velcro seems strong\u2026 and the shoe itself looks like it could be a nice lightweight option for someone with feet that aren\u2019t as \u201ctall\u201d or swollen as my dads.  We will keep them to use when he needs to walk to the bathroom etc\u2026 but I will be doing some cutting and a little redoing to make them work for us.", "review_title": "Weren\u2019t tall enough", "date_written": "2023-11-29", "product_asin": "B0B36DGFM3", "country": "the United States", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 2.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//FitVille-Diabetic-Orthopedic-Adjustable-Fasciitis/product-reviews/B0B71X3PT1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "a6e590b4-2bf9-490a-9df3-62f09a4d7ae0", "review_ref": "R2ZPI3UP19TIRN", "product_id": "bbfc9f7d-f500-450d-819b-e0d47d9f9ea1", "review_content": "In diesen Schuhen kann ich nicht 10 Std laufen.

Die Schuhe machen optisch einen guten Eindruck, der Geruch schien mir etwas chemisch, aber nicht allzu penetrant. Die Verarbeitung der Schuhe war gut, was man bei dem Preis aber auch erwartet. Die Passform ist gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig ausgelegt und trotz der Weite sieht der Schuh nicht klobig aus. Schade, leider passte der Schuh nicht, er ist wohl eher f\u00fcr sehr stark geschwollene F\u00fc\u00dfe geeignet. Das Fu\u00dfbett ist sehr bequem, der Schuh ist jedoch insgesamt deutlich weiter als vermutet und sitzt trotz geschwollener F\u00fc\u00dfe sehr locker und schluppt. Sicherlich genau das richtige Modell, wenn man z.B. eine Fu\u00df OP hatte und einen dicken Verband tragen muss - er bietet wirklich sehr viel Platz, auch \u00fcber den hohen Spann. Absolut bequem verarbeitet und somit f\u00fcr richtig dick angeschwollene F\u00fc\u00dfe bestimmt bestens geeignet. Bin gespannt ob ich mein Geld irgendwann doch noch erstattet bekomme oder nicht.

Every shoe manufacturer uses different measurements in terms of instep height, toe shape and foot width. However, the basis for your own shoe size is always the length of your feet. Thus, you should always determine your foot length before buying in order to choose the right shoe.       Step 1: tracing your feet   Take off your socks, place a piece of paper against a wall, and place your foot on it so that your heel touches the wall. Now use a pen to trace the shape of the foot on the front of the toes. Hold the pen exactly upright.   Important: Both feet must be measured, as they are often of different lengths! Feet often swell during the day, which is why we recommend taking the measurement in the late afternoon.       Step 2: measure   Now you can measure the edge of the paper from where the heel was to the longest toe and determine the length of your foot. Use your longer foot as a guidance. We calculated the necessary allowance for enough space in the shoe for you. Find the size that fits your foot length and the allowance included in our shoe size table to make the right choice.             Step 3: Look it up in the shoe size table       ", "revised_description": null, "product_asin": "B077MJHTPG", "overall_ratings": 4.4, "total_customers_that_rated": 75184, "price": 48.0, "currency": "\u00a3", "category": "Fashion", "sub_category": "Men's Fashion", "product_page_url": "https://amazon.co.uk/Puma-Unisex-Low-Top-Sneakers-White-Puma/dp/B077MJHTPG/ref=sr_1_224?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Nh0gkThlUe1uRd2U6noIiVgsNSKbkZEvhtQR-2bjIk4HFF-VOUk1xTg7yBZuv73H4ggxuwbV6esW1mkaritheo4xt2Ych3GtWJqIrGyUSMc3jNNVhkDbzJIfkOSwCcPMQbmFSO1FG06S_A_qNKfdTdnrHUd3dLvw_Pu3vAUXOePS_DVlZbNrDA-T8nhsi1Rk-5hyWn6Yxp_PR8NI0HcLyOPMmB5s5gcSiwZxJ9v55eUAceLxASgfR-M0tvc4cdqvhGQRstkSKdeW2hp-b0qHtPzawbr_Ll54RJft3qd8AQI.-JIHDvxnPhK_VzpQLnCbEPAeQD5m0XJ8T7WlPqNObdk&dib_tag=se&qid=1710844379&s=apparel&sr=1-224", "image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PcY8duhuL._AC_UL960_QL65_.jpg", "reviews": [{"id": "beb472a4-8cb0-45f1-90bc-98dae2aae28e", "review_ref": "R1DWGKTX65GZK8", "product_id": "8a5e9cad-679e-4258-a3ae-e7cc291f0013", "review_content": "These are possibly the worst training shoes I've ever bought.

As long as you don't beat your shoes to death like me they will last longer as a result of constant abuse my pair have worn heavily on the soles but haven't worn through and the heal on the insole if completely worn away and the insole has started to break away. The inside lining has began to wear holes and some of the finish has peeled of on the left shoe. These have taken a beating and have stood the test of time.They are incredibly comfy to wear since they are very padded with foam and don't cause my feet to get sore due to this they are great for wearing casually for hours on end and became my go too shoe for college due to their monotone look and excellent comfort as a result they beat out comparable offerings from Adidas since the shoes i had before were a pair of Adidas gazelles which i literally wore a hole into the sole however despite these being comfortable i thought they lacked padding which the pumas excel at due to this i prefer them to other life style shoes like converse, vans and more. If your like me and are quite heavy footed you will benefit dramatically from the foam.Despite being a tennis shoe it doesn't scream sporty with no massive logo or perforations due to this combined with monotone colour options the are perfect as a life style shoe and can definitely pass as a \"white sneakers\" style shoe but with much more comfort.Overall I highly recommend them if you like shoes of this style since i find that similar shoes from Adidas lack padding and feel very flat these on the other hand have a padded and cushioned feel to the point were i could wear them for more than 8 hours a day and can stand up to daily use of that duration. The clean design and monotone colours also make them excellent for a minimal everyday shoe.", "review_title": "Probably the best shoes you can get for \u00a330", "date_written": "2023-01-16", "product_asin": "B077MJHTPG", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 26, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//PUMA-Unisexs-Smash-Low-top-Sneakers/product-reviews/B0CX57H81Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "6f87fc59-864c-4a42-be46-d7ec6ad572e8", "review_ref": "R1T8DEZN8RTM6K", "product_id": "8a5e9cad-679e-4258-a3ae-e7cc291f0013", "review_content": "I recommend it very good quality and good in price too", "review_title": "Very nice and light", "date_written": "2024-03-13", "product_asin": "B077MJHTPG", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//PUMA-Unisexs-Smash-Low-top-Sneakers/product-reviews/B0CX57H81Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "45dd4897-7dc5-482e-a1e9-8dcafaa77057", "review_ref": "R3MA0ZNUEUNBWO", "product_id": "8a5e9cad-679e-4258-a3ae-e7cc291f0013", "review_content": "Bought it as I needed a pair of shoes to be water repellantVery comfortable and true to sizeBut if u have a wider feet, probably get half size bigger", "review_title": "Good price and comfortable", "date_written": "2024-02-29", "product_asin": "B077MJHTPG", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 5.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//PUMA-Unisexs-Smash-Low-top-Sneakers/product-reviews/B0CX57H81Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "d3fb64a0-46b5-4ee0-ae68-bde714cc10f9", "review_ref": "R2A75TB8APM1HY", "product_id": "8a5e9cad-679e-4258-a3ae-e7cc291f0013", "review_content": "Pros:Having purchased these during a flash sale (\u00a325) I am very pleased, that said I would have felt hard done by had I bought these at full price.

One  pair of my Classic Crocs are my house slippers and I have been wearing them consistently since they came a few days ago, and due to having Sesamoiditis in both feet, one case rather bad, I had been wearing the Crocs for the garden out and about prior to receiving the Baya. Unfortunately I do not find the Baya to be as comfortable as the Classic, the roof of the clog seems to be considerably lower, low enough to have caused my arched feet alot of discomfort, for the first 15 minutes of walking I was in alot of pain, continually slipping my feet out of the Baya for relief. My Classic Crocs made me forget how much the Sesamoiditis was effecting me and the Baya reminded me immediately and with surprise. My left foot has the most pain with the right being very mild (with the sesamoiditis), I found myself limping, again within 15 minutes and my right foot is now inflamed and sore again. I did however notice the after 30 minutes or so the roof of the Baya started to loosen somewhat, so I'm thinking that moreso than with the Classic, your feet has to mould the Baya to achieve the best fit, I'm hoping? Otherwise, in terms of the size, I am happy with them.

The socks don't have too much stretch and I think those with larger calves may struggle.You get a good amount of socks for the price age they feel good but upon wearing the yellow ones I heard a thread tear and upon closer inspection, the area at my heel is thinning out. It looks like an important thread at the heel broke while I was putting it on and now there isn't much protection for the back. Over time that area will wear out very quickly and might unravel the whole sock. In disappointed with this quality so I've removed 2 stars.UPDATES:1) I've found that the elastic isn't properly sewn. The elasticated \"cuff\" thing around your calf is folded over and sewn on the inside but it's only attached in some areas and not ask the way around.2) Also it dawned on me that these socks are meant to be for feet sizes 6 through 11 but just barely fit my 8.5 feet. The black band that goes around the centre of my foot (wrapping around the arch area) is rigid. There's next to no stretch. Larger feet will struggle! I've removed an additional star for this because you expect things to fit the size on the label and not be pot luck.

But I figured I'd take a flyer on these slippers as I liked the look of them and wanted ones with rubber soles. I live in Ireland and so the ground outside is perpetually wet and I wanted to be able to pop out to the garden or garage if i needed to without my feet getting soaked from the bottom.These work great and are holding up, they are really warm, too. They do fit slightly large. I am almost always a US 9/UK 8/EU 42 and these fit loose unless I wear socks with them. You wouldn't notice the looseness around the house as you wont take big strides like outside so it's okay, and tbh I find wearing socks with them works better anyway because the fleece lining is so warm your feet will sweat way more without socks. Without socks i will only wear them for 20 minutes due to that. That's why I took off one star because to me the whole point of slippers is right in the name - slip them on my bare feet to do litle bits and pieces around the house before i get properly dressed or after cooking home.

Were you like me and bought them from a supermarket? They looked OK at the time, but soon disintegrated after a couple of month's wear? If so, these may be what you've been looking for!After a bit of research, these VeraCosy slippers seemed to combine the perfect balance between quality and value. With the exception of the slightly twee name, all looked good and I ordered a pair.As is usually the case with Amazon, they were delivered the next day and I found myself unfeasibly excited to try them on!  They definitely didn't disappoint!These slippers fit exactly as expected, which was a relief. The plush lining provided a good degree of warmth, and the rubberised sole gave both grip and comfort around the house.  That can be especially important on laminate or marble floors, where smooth soled slippers can be dangerously slippy. Just for clarity, the soles haven't marked any of the floor coverings, which I was initially concerned about.The design of these slippers, with the back of them extending up over the heel (in contrast to the lower slip-on styles) also allows for improved safety when ascending or descending stairs. You'd be shocked at how many people - particularly, but not exclusively, in later life - suffer awful injuries through tripping on stairs or carpets due to ill-fitting slippers. I'm confident that these are sufficiently well designed to minimise that risk.I've had these for about a month or so, and due to lock-down they've been on my feet for most of each day. They're still as warm and comfortable as on the day they arrived, and I'd have no hesitation in recommending them to you.*** If you've found this review useful, please hit the \"Helpful\" button.

Those too were excellent until going out in the first wet and boggy outing this autumn, I came back with a soaking wet left foot, where the boot had leaked due to a hairline split where the sole joins the shoe area of the boot. Hopefully that issue was from a 'one off' faulty pair as Lakeland Active themselves states was probably the case. Amazon were excellent in agreeing a refund for the faulty purchase back in this Spring.. Fingers crossed for this pair. Revised report today: I have now returned the latest boots from Lakeland Active because they also leak- after 5 months wear! Rubber persishing on both boots. These have been carefully looked after and cleaned regularly with plain water only. Now there are two of these lasting no longer than 5 to 6 months its clear they are not up to the job of regular use. Its a shame really as they are comfortable wellies and as near as you can get to calling them a stylish item. I will NOT be buying anymore Lakeland Active boots.

Das ist aber auch vollkommen ausreichend so.Die Hose sieht super aus. Sie wird mit zwei Kn\u00f6pfen und einem leicht g\u00e4ngigen Rei\u00dfverschluss geschlossen. Der hohe Stretchanteil macht die Hose super bequem. Sie macht jede Bewegung mit. Fast so wie eine LeggingsIch trage normalerweise gro\u00dfe M bis kleines L und die Hose in 34/32 passt mir perfekt. Sie ist sehr modern geschnitten und eignet sich sowohl f\u00fcr die Freizeit als auch f\u00fcr eine festliche Veranstaltung.Eigentlich die perfekte Hose. Aber auch nur eigentlich, denn die Materialien aus der sie hergestellt wurde sind nicht besonders umweltfreundlich. Die Materialzusammensetzung besteht zu 75% aus Polyester, zu 22% Viskose und 3% Elasthan. Das Futter besteht sogar zu 100% aus Polyester.Polyester ist ein \u00dcberbegriff f\u00fcr verschiedene Kunststoffe mit unterschiedlichen Eigenschaften. Die Vorteile der Fasern ist das, sie relativ rei\u00dffest sind und lange in Form bleiben. Das gro\u00dfe Problem bei Kleidung mit Polyesterfasern ist allerdings, das sich beim waschen immer winzige Fasern herausl\u00f6sen und die winzigen Fasern dann als Mikroplastik ins Abwasser gelangen. Kl\u00e4ranlagen k\u00f6nnen die winzigen Partikel leider nicht herausfiltern und somit gelangen sie in die Meere.Da Viskose aus recycelten Pflanzenresten besteht, wird das Material h\u00e4ufig als umweltfreundlich und nachhaltig bezeichnet. Die Herstellung erfordert allerdings viele verschiedene Chemikalien wie Natronlauge, Schwefelkohlenstoff und Schwefels\u00e4ure. Das sind nur einige der Stoffe, die bei der Herstellung eine Rolle spielen. Auf der einen Seite haben wir also einen Stoff, der aus nat\u00fcrlichem und nachhaltigem Material besteht und auf der anderen Seite haben wir die Nutzung h\u00e4ufig giftiger Chemikalien.Wenn Sie nichts auf die Umwelt geben und eine bequeme Hose m\u00f6chten, sind Sie mit dieser Pant-Hose sicherlich gut bedient.

I purchased three pairs just over three months ago and all three are starting to fall apart. The drawstrings have become detached on two pairs with absolutely no way of re-threading and reattaching them and a hole has appeared out of nowhere in the third pair. Okay, I know these weren't the most expensive of shorts but still, you would expect them to last more than a month each on average!!These shorts are pretty well made but have two significant failings. The first is that the waist band and label are ridiculously harsh and therefore can be quite uncomfortable if worn directly on the skin, even after carefully removing the label. The second is that the drawstring is rubbish. I had one pair (of which I bought three!!) where the stitching at the back of the waistband came apart and the drawstring came out but as the channel for the cord is so ludicrously tight, it is impossible to get the original string (or any other string for that matter) threaded back through. Why would they make the cord in two parts like this? Surely it would make more sense to have one continuous drawstring!!", "review_title": "Don't waste your money!!", "date_written": "2018-10-05", "product_asin": "B00AKSCXES", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 1, "rating_given": 1.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//Champion-G856H-Mens-Shorts/product-reviews/B09MR29G1V/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "6917a174-fa36-49e1-9fcf-5250b9874357", "review_ref": "R1FMA0EHT9LZU3", "product_id": "3f7dfc0a-1ac0-489d-94ec-7449aaae1516", "review_content": "Very big sizing", "review_title": "Good quality for the price", "date_written": "2018-11-27", "product_asin": "B00AKSCXES", "country": "the United Kingdom", "helpful_count": 0, "rating_given": 4.0, "review_page_url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk//Champion-G856H-Mens-Shorts/product-reviews/B09MR29G1V/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star", "sentiment": null, "product_aspects": null}, {"id": "dbe0bb4c-88a4-49ec-be6a-e53549845d81", "review_ref": "R7SAT81A4FTOU", "product_id": "3f7dfc0a-1ac0-489d-94ec-7449aaae1516", "review_content": "I have several Powerblend Champion joggers of excellent quality and whilst the shorts are not power blend I would still expect good quality but these are awful and started return shortly after opening them.

The stretch was a bonus.  Wrangler market this as mid-rise together with the aforementioned comfort factors.  The waist was very low, showing my boxers back and front and seemed even in height all around.  Normally, jeans are somewhat higher at the back.  Not these.  There was also a gap in the back waistband centre which would need a belt to close it.  This is a real pity as the colour was great and the leg length and slight taper were nice but the fit in crucial areas, for me, was all wrong, especially the waist height.  I would not describe these jeans as mid-rise; they were more like low-rise.  They were returned for a refund and a lesson was learned.

Quite liked them, great value, so figured while I was at it I'd stock up with another 12 pairs... figuring that as they randomly wear, I could throw away the odd individual worn ones and pair up with whatever's left.Also figured having a lot of the same design would be easy to pair up after washing.So imagine my disappointment when I open up my latest delivery, check out the socks, put them next to the ones I bought a few weeks ago, and now find they're not exactly the same. The stripes are different. See attached photo.So I can't cross-pair them with the ones already purchased.When I check them against the illustration right now, these that have just arrived do match the illustration as it appears today. But I could have sworn that I did the same when I bought my first set just a few weeks ago, and I could have sworn they matched the picture at that time as well.It does bug me that it's telling me at the top of the page \"purchased 2 times\" .... I disagree. The two purchases would appear to be different products. If I'd purchase the same product two times, I'd be able to cross pair them.It's really annoying because now I'm going to have to root around a lot more to pair up the socks after they've come out of the washing machine. And as they wear out, I won't be able to mix and match the remaining good socks from the two different purchases.Basically I now have 12 sets of 2 pairs each, instead of the 6 sets of 4 pairs each that I expected to end up with.And worse still, although the patterns aren't completely the same, they are still similar, which is going to make finding the partners in the unsorted laundry even more difficult.The new socks also appear to be somewhat bigger fit than the previous pair. I've just tried one on and the heel on the new sock comes up beyond my actual heel. The original purchase a few weeks ago had them at the right point. Though perhaps these new ones will shrink in the wash... the original ones have had a couple of washes already.Oh well, at least at \u00a39.99 for 12 they're really good value.My overall 3 star rating reflects that fact that you can't be sure what you're buying. My original purchase would have been 5 stars. But if you supposedly order the same thing a second time just 3 or 4 weeks later, and find they aren't the same thing you bought previously, that does somewhat undermine the value.Amazon really should indicate on their listings whether product pages are 'placeholders' for generic things. Not only can't you be sure of what you're buying if you 'buy again', but also it undermines trust in the reviews and ratings when reviews remain in place, but the product in the page changes.", "review_title": "What was I buying?

A good bulk buy when you just need plenty of black cotton socks in the drawer for every day use. The toe and heel colours are useful to match them up after washing, and if one wears through it's no problem using pairs made of different colours...unless you're wearing them with sandals.

Some said they were far too small and some said miles too big. One reviewer even said they were cut funny and cut into his bum crack uncomfortably. My son really needed something similar for work and I couldn't find a pair of black cargo shorts anywhere else so in the end I just went for it and ordered his normal size with my fingers crossed that they would fit OK. When they arrived he was out so I laid them up against another pair of his shorts, bought from Tesco that I knew fitted him well and the waistband was EXACTLY the same size and sure enough, when he came home and tried them on, they fitted him fine. He always wears a size 30 inch waist which is a fraction loose on him but he uses a belt and prefers them comfy. I asked him if they cut anywhere or were loose anywhere else and he did a few Ninja type moves in them to demonstrate that they were not uncomfortable, did not cut into him or restrict his movement in any way. They are not made from a stretchy fabric but the material is very nice and the shorts look smart, despite the pockets on the leg. There is no sag or loss of shape if you use the pockets, provided they are not over-loaded. So, if you are thinking about buying these shorts and are put off by the contradicting reviews, I would just go for it. Different retailers have different ideas about sizing and some cut stingily and others generously so I would just buy your normal size and have a little faith.
