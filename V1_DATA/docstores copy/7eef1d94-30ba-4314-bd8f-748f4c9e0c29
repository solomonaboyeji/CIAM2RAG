You can wear the boots every day. The boots are 100% waterproof. They keep your feet dry in wet and dirty conditions.      The best boots around the house   Dunlop looks back on a long tradition as a manufacturer of wellington boots. In 1927, the company made the first Dunlop Wellington. Many families worldwide have been wearing Dunlop's cheerful, timeless and waterproof boots for generations.   The best in-class Dunlop PVC boots are robust and durable. Dunlop wellies are flexible and available in different colors and for different seasons. The flexible sole ensures that you can work and walk on many surfaces.       Work in the garden     Wash your car     Play outside     Walk through the woods     Enjoy the beach               What you should know about us    We are Dunlop Protective Footwear, global manufacturer of protective footwear. In more than 50 countries worldwide, we provide comfortable and protective footwear for you. Our continuous innovation combined with a solid dose of handcraft, makes the most comfortable boots in the world. To give you the safety and comfort you deserve.   At Dunlop we design, develop and manufacture all of our high quality waterproof boots ourselves. In this process, we depend on you. When you are a farmer, safety means something else for you than when you are a construction builder. Working in a food processing plant requires other footwear than working on an oil platform or working in the garden. We understand that. So we developed boots especially for you. We look at you, listen to you and invest in continuous innovation, embracing original expertise with new technology. Our boots are characterized by comfort, innovation, and protection. We bring these three key features together to bring you unique, professional footwear that gives you the safety and comfort you deserve.              You can use your Dunlop boots throughout the year                                      All-season's boots   In winter time you want extra protection from the cold. Warm feet are a must! The Blizzard range for kids and adults features a warm, fur lining and special lacing to keep you and your kids extra warm and comfortable. And safe as well, as the extra traction outsole layer prevents you from slipping on wet or icy roads.       For dry feet all day   Whether you work in the garden, do little chores around the house or walk your dog, you want your feet to be warm, dry and protected. You want your boots to keep your feet dry. They should be 100% waterproof. But you also want your feet to be comfortable, so you can walk, work or play the whole day long.       For all ages   Since a man\u2019s foot differs from a woman\u2019s foot and the foot of a little kid, Dunlop adapted the design of her boots to the needs of its user. The last of our various boots is therefore adapted to the shape and contours of the feet of children, men and women, aged from 2 to 102. Which boot suits you best?       For everyone's taste   Nothing is more personal than choosing your favorite color. Some like pink, others like blue. How about you? Do you stick to the traditional green boot, or do you dare to stand out from the crowd with our bright new colors? \nProduct ID: 7eef1d94-30ba-4314-bd8f-748f4c9e0c29 \nProduct Asin: B0014E7RPC \nOverall Ratings 4.5 \nTotal Customers that rated: 2665 \nPrice: \u00a317.99 \n", "id": null}
