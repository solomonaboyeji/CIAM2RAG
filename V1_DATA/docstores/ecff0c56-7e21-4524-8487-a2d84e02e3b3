It all started in 1877 when sea captain Helly Juell Hansen found a better way to stay protected from the harsh Norwegian elements. Soon thereafter, Captain Hansen and his wife Margrethe launched a business producing waterproof oilskin jackets, trousers, sou\u2019westers and tarpaulins made from coarse linen soaked in linseed oil \u2013 and the legend was born!         Helly Hansen Technology                                      Helly Tech   Helly Tech is the waterproof and breathable outer layer between you and the elements. Its unique membrane keeps water molecules out, while allowing sweat vapor to pass through \u2013 keeping you dry from the outside and comfortable on the inside.       Lifa   LIFA is an ultra-light weight base layer fabric that works perfectly in the autumn and winter. HH LIFA delivers light insulation and moisture management through its 100% single layer Lifa fibers. The Lifa technology works best when layered under another garment, as the more garments you wear, the further the sweat and moisture will be transported out of the fabric and away from your skin.       Lifaloft   LIFALOFT is an insulation revolution that will keep you warmer with less weight and bulk due to the unique LIFA yarn technology.   LIFALOFT insulation is based on a yarn technology that traps more air vs polyester at a lighter weight. The fibre doesn\u00b4t absorbs water and has inherit water repellence without the need for treatment due to the hydrophobic properties of the Lifa fibres which makes this insulation technology ideally for year around adventures in any condition and keeps you warm even when wet.       H2Flow   H2Flow is a temperature regulation system that was developed together with mountain professionals to provide skiers with versatility and comfort in changing weather conditions and fluctuating activity levels. The technology keeps you warm by storing hot air, and also allows you to cool down through ventilation zippers.
