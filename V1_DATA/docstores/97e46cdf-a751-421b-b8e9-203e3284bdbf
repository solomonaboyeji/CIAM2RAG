Properly measuring your hat size can ensure you get the perfect fitted hat. So it not only looks good, but feels great too!   How to and what you will need   You will need:   - measuring tape   - or a piece of string and a ruler   How to:   1) Wrap the measuring tape or piece of string around the largest part of your head. This will usually be around your eye-brows and forehead.   2) Mark the spot where the two ends meet around your head (make sure it is tightly wrapped around for a more accurate measurement)   If you are using a measuring tape, note down the measurement in centimetres.   If you are using a string, straighten out the string that was wrapped around your head and measure using the ruler in CM.            The vintage Baker Boy style - made with a soft and thick Melton Wool Fabric.   Our Bridgemoor Cap is a classic design with natural rich colours thanks to the compact weave of Melton Wool. The thickness of the outer material gives our Bridgemoor Cap great weatherproof qualities.   Melton Wool was first produced centuries ago in the town of Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, UK. As a place widely considered the national hotspot for hunting and other outdoor sports - it embraced Melton Wool as an ideal fabric for hunting clothing due to its weatherproofing. Although the fabric has a smooth, cushioned surface - it is thick and rigid due to the manufacturing process. Melton Wool is heavily \u2018fulled\u2019. This process involves first scouring the material. A treatment used to remove the natural contaminants contained within the wool such as oil and dirt.  It is then milled. A process which increases the thickness and compactness of the fabric using heat, moisture and friction. This results in a fabric which is both soft to the touch, thick and durable.   We always strive to bring you a hat manufactured to the highest of standards. W&H have been developing wool caps for over 20 years, so you can be assured of top quality design and manufacturing.   A perfect choice during the colder months. This tightly woven cloth is one of the warmest fabrics you can find. Along with the firm fitting you should expect from a W&H hat - you can be sure your head will be kept warm from cold winds.  The natural water-resistance and compactness of Melton Wool will help keep your head dry during showers.   A classic style which never seems to go away. You can wear your Bridgemoor cap whether out for an active day in the country or an evening in the town. Style your Bridgemoor Cap with our selection of country clothing.
