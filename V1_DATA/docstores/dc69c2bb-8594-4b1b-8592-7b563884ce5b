Compression over the arch is designed to help you stimulate blood flow and provide muscle support, in turn minimizing post-run soreness.   Trainer shoes are a breeding ground for bacteria, which of course means your socks are going to stink. Our trainer socks use odour-free technology and are covered in silver ions to kill germs, keeping feet dry and fresh all day.                Ventilated mesh panelling on the top adds breathability and improves airflow, which keeps you cool during training.           Thick cushion on the heel and sole provides impact protection to reduce sock and foot pain during sports or daily activity.           The ankle socks are reinforced on the heel and the toe to ensure hole free, help your feet withstand those multi-mile or long-haul walks.           Cotton and Lycra in the blend make the socks soft stretch for a comfortable hug on the foot. High tab on the back protects the foot from blisters. \nProduct Asin: B07WQTBRCM \nOverall Ratings 4.7 \nTotal Customers that rated: 6867 \nPric: \u00a312.79 \n", "id": null}
