Within two short decades, a cultural revolution had changed the world and Wrangler had moved with it. What had started as functional utility wear, designed to withstand rugged work, soon became the uniform of the youth movement. Created for rodeo riders and ranch hands, Wrangler was adopted by trailblazers and rock stars and throughout its history, the authentic all-American denim icon has created era-defining style.                                    Did you know?    The Wrangler name was coined when a Blue Bell employee entered the name in a competition. It was chosen for being synonymous with cowboys.       Did you know?   The W-stitch on the back pockets of every pair of Wranglers doesn't stand for Wrangler. These ones mean Western Wear.       Did you know?   In the 1940s, Rodeo Ben created 11 prototypes of Wrangler jeans before he was happy with the original fit. \nProduct Asin: B07G8GQGZS \nOverall Ratings 4.4 \nTotal Customers that rated: 6631 \nPric: \u00a337.65 \n", "id": null}
