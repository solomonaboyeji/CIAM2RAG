I run and walk a lot so those Asics are superb. Price wise these are, at full price, similar to the Asics but would say the Fitvilles don’t quite live up the same quality and functional design detailing of Asics. These get a huge thumbs up for width and arch support built in but I would describe these as general footwear and not sports shoes. The main reasons would be - the fit is a little loose (ironically width) around the arch area of the foot, the heal fit is also a tad too flat so doesn’t fit snuggly to my heal shape. The final issue is the lacing and tongue. The tongue isn’t separate to the sides - more like a slip on - so limits the tightening up. The lacing holes fall short in distance at the ankle compared to most sport specific shoes. This results in a too loose fit around the ankle for running or any sport - in my opinion and for my desired fit - everyone is different.  I would recommend these as wide fit daily footwear but not sports shoes. A real plus for Fitville is the arch support and stock wide fitting that are available. My reason for not simply re ordering Asics comes down to the usual issue with specialist sports brands - they never seem to either have stock or keep the range consistent.', 'review_title': 'Great wide fit shoe but, perhaps, not for sports.', 'date_written': '2022-11-05', 'product_asin': 'B09Y927NYF', 'country': 'the United Kingdom', 'helpful_count': 7, 'rating_given': 4.0, 'review_page_url': 'https://www.amazon.co.uk//FitVille-Trainers-Athletic-Sneakers-Breathable/product-reviews/B0B3J252M4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star', 'sentiment': None, 'product_aspects': None}, {'id': '250a5071-ac77-4a6c-9981-e6f1016e88c1', 'review_ref': 'R2SHADQAVHLFAS', 'product_id': 'fde9e6c3-6ae2-40c6-b9bf-27c726ebfe9b', 'review_content': \"Firstly, I really like fitville shoes, this being my 4th pair.I find the fit brilliant, (I wear the wide, not extra wide), and they're really comfortable.HOWEVER!The tread seems to wear remarkably fast, this pair for instance I've had a week, yup seven days worn probably 4 days and the tread is already disappearing, it's not as I walk much, I'm a driver by trade.My last two pairs were similar and the first pair cracked across the sole making them unwearable.If fitville sorted it's soles then they'd be on to a winner.\", 'review_title': 'Sole wears incredibly fast', 'date_written': '2023-07-16', 'product_asin': 'B09Y927NYF', 'country': 'the United Kingdom', 'helpful_count': 6, 'rating_given': 4.0, 'review_page_url': 'https://www.amazon.co.uk//FitVille-Trainers-Athletic-Sneakers-Breathable/product-reviews/B0B3J252M4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star', 'sentiment': None, 'product_aspects': None}, {'id': '140d93d9-d702-4c6e-a9f6-6812d87dda1a', 'review_ref': 'R82U71W9YL9WA', 'product_id': 'fde9e6c3-6ae2-40c6-b9bf-27c726ebfe9b', 'review_content': 'Ideal if you have bionions and  need the extra toe room', 'review_title': 'Plenty of room extra wide', 'date_written': '2023-10-20', 'product_asin': 'B09Y927NYF', 'country': 'the United Kingdom', 'helpful_count': 0, 'rating_given': 4.0, 'review_page_url': 'https://www.amazon.co.uk//FitVille-Trainers-Athletic-Sneakers-Breathable/product-reviews/B0B3J252M4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star', 'sentiment': None, 'product_aspects': None}, {'id': 'ec2a670a-9774-4297-805a-b96c54e3ecd8', 'review_ref': 'R1WHURYP5ZHTZ5', 'product_id': 'fde9e6c3-6ae2-40c6-b9bf-27c726ebfe9b', 'review_content': 'These are a good solid pair of trainers.
