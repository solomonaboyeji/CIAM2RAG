We are SOCKSHOP, a team of total sock fanatics based in a beautiful old mill in Bolton, in the north of England, UK. We are determined to bring you a huge range of socks, underwear, tights and more expertly handpicked by us.   Founded in 1983 by Sophie Mirman and Richard P. Ross after Mirman said \"People should be able to buy socks as easily as they buy newspapers.\" SOCKSHOP outlets were placed for convenience on busy city streets, in train stations and at airports. SOCKSHOP was acquired by us, The Ruia Group, early in 2006. Not just selling our beautiful range of SOCKSHOP branded items we also stock over 45 brilliant brands including Jeep, Pringle, ELLE, Jeff Banks, Pantherella and so many more.       The brands we sell...      SOCKSHOP     ELLE     Pringle     Glenmuir     HEAT HOLDERS     Jeep     And so many more...                                                                                SO, WHATS THE FUSS ABOUT BAMBOO?   Bamboo fibres are turned into viscose that becomes yarn, which is what makes bamboo socks so soft, silky and comfy. The soft, long and gently rounded staples (the microscopic fibres bamboo is composed of) are non-irritating, making bamboo socks and clothing great for sensitive skin.   Bamboo is kind to the planet as well as your skin. Bamboo is naturally antibacterial, helping it to resist crop-destroying bugs and diseases without growers using soil-damaging pesticides. It grows really fast too, and doesn\u2019t need as much field space as crops like cotton, so you can grow more per acre. It\u2019s very water-efficient too, saving important resources. And bamboo produces 35% more oxygen into the atmosphere than trees - amazing stuff!
