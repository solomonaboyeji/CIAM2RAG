The classic Superga 2750 is a real design object created in 1925 when the young Turin entrepreneur Walter Martiny experimented with the first prototype of a rubber sole tennis shoe for his wife.       The 2790 platform: new heights and the style of ever.   The Superga 2790 sneaker reinterprets the iconic model with a 4 cm wedge that slims the silhouette and combines casually with denim and more feminine looks.       The 2790 rope: a boho inspiration - chic.   The cotton canvas upper is extremely durable and breathable while the braided rope foxing adds to the look an ethnic flavor that does not go unnoticed.                                         The 2730 lam\u00e8: the evolution of an icon.   The Superga 2730 sneaker reinterprets the unisex model with a slightly higher 3 cm sole that slims the figure and respects the elements of the brand's lifestyle DNA. Lam\u00e9 upper, cotton lining and vulcanized natural rubber sole.       Say it with a sneaker: the 2790 platform lettering!   The Superga maxi lettering is the mantra of the season and signs the distinctive style of this model with a 4 cm high wedge.   Classic label with bicolor jacquard logo, lined interior and many colors to collect.       The 2750 Macram\u00e8   This reinterpretation of the iconic Superga 2750 is a unique concentration of style and femininity. The model surprises with a refined macram\u00e9 lace embroidery on the upper and is finished with cotton laces, logo label on the side and vulcanized natural rubber sole.                                                                                               2750 COTU CLASSIC                                               2790 PLATFORM                                               2790 ROPE                                               2730 BLADES                                               2790 PLATFORM LETTERING                                               2750 MACRAME                Add To Basket              Add To Basket              Add To Basket              Add To Basket              Add To Basket              Add To Basket         Customer Reviews      4.5 out of 5 stars  33,363      4.5 out of 5 stars  33,363      4.5 out of 5 stars  33,363      4.5 out of 5 stars  33,363      4.5 out of 5 stars  33,363      4.5 out of 5 stars  33,363       Price    \u00a347.49\u00a347.49   \u00a347.49\u00a347.49   \u00a347.49\u00a347.49   \u00a347.49\u00a347.49   \u00a347.49\u00a347.49   \u00a347.49\u00a347.49      Upper     Breathable cotton canvas upper     Breathable cotton canvas upper     Breathable cotton canvas upper     Lam\u00e8 upper     Breathable cotton canvas upper     Macrame lace upper       Sole     Vulcanized natural rubber sole     Vulcanized natural rubber sole     Vulcanized natural rubber sole     Vulcanized natural rubber sole     Superga lettering vulcanized natural rubber sole     Vulcanized natural rubber sole       Platform         Wedge 4 cm high     4 cm high wedge with braided rope foxing     Wedge 3 cm high     Wedge 4 cm high           Season     Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter     Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter     Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter     Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter     Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter     Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter                 LIFESTYLE AND TIMELESS AESTHETICS EXCEPES IN KID VERSION                                      2750 BABY CLASSIC   This 2750 model is an excellent interpreter of every child's first steps thanks to the breathable cotton canvas upper, rounded toe and vulcanized rubber sole.       2750 KIDS STRAPS EASYLITE   A unique mix of iconic elements and functional details.
