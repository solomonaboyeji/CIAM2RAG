How to find the right shoe size?                              Why is this important?   Shoe sizes are not standardized. Every shoe manufacturer uses different measurements in terms of instep height, toe shape and foot width. However, the basis for your own shoe size is always the length of your feet. Thus, you should always determine your foot length before buying in order to choose the right shoe.       Step 1: tracing your feet   Take off your socks, place a piece of paper against a wall, and place your foot on it so that your heel touches the wall. Now use a pen to trace the shape of the foot on the front of the toes. Hold the pen exactly upright.   Important: Both feet must be measured, as they are often of different lengths! Feet often swell during the day, which is why we recommend taking the measurement in the late afternoon.       Step 2: measure   Now you can measure the edge of the paper from where the heel was to the longest toe and determine the length of your foot. Use your longer foot as a guidance. We calculated the necessary allowance for enough space in the shoe for you. Find the size that fits your foot length and the allowance included in our shoe size table to make the right choice.             Step 3: Look it up in the shoe size table \nProduct Asin: B077MG7LKQ \nOverall Ratings 4.5 \nTotal Customers that rated: 39005 \nPric: \u00a333.99 \n", "id": null}
