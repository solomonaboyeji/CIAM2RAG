Our two founders, Brian Gaskin and Roy   Holmes, set out to produce the ultimate clothing for the harshest of   outdoor adventures. And to test it, they took it from the Peak District   all the way to Mount Everest. Founders Gaskin and Holmes were  cherry-picked to manufacture the  expedition clothing needed for Chris  Bonington's Everest expedition in  1975 - the first successful climb by  ascending the face of the mountain.
